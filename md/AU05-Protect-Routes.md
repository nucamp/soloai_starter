# Route Protection and Authentication Guards

## Overview
Implement comprehensive route protection system for authenticated areas of the SaaS application using Better Auth session management. Create middleware to guard `/account`, `/dashboard`, and other protected routes while providing seamless user experience with proper redirects and loading states.

**Feature Type**: Technical Integration

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a guest user, I want to be automatically redirected to `/login` when I try to access protected routes so that I understand authentication is required
- As an authenticated user, I want seamless access to protected routes without unnecessary redirects so that I can use the application efficiently
- As a user with an expired session, I want to be redirected to login with my intended destination preserved so that I can continue where I left off after re-authenticating

### Functional Requirements
1. **Route Protection**: All routes under `/account/*` and `/dashboard/*` must require valid authentication
2. **Session Validation**: Verify Better Auth session validity on each protected route access
3. **Redirect Handling**: Preserve intended destination URL for post-login redirect using `?redirect` parameter
4. **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during authentication checks to prevent UI flash
5. **Error Handling**: Handle session expiration, network errors, and authentication failures gracefully
6. **Client-Side Guards**: Implement reactive authentication checks that update when session state changes
7. **Server-Side Protection**: Ensure protected routes return 401/403 status codes for unauthenticated requests
8. **Nested Route Support**: Protect all child routes under protected parent routes automatically

### Security Considerations
- Session validation must occur on both client and server side
- Protected routes must not expose sensitive data to unauthenticated users
- Redirect URLs must be validated to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities
- Authentication state must be tamper-proof using Better Auth JWT validation
- Rate limiting should be considered for authentication check endpoints

### Performance Requirements
- Authentication checks must complete within 100ms
- Protected route loading must not introduce noticeable delay
- Session validation should use cached results when appropriate
- Failed authentication checks should fail fast without blocking UI

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Better Auth client from `AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md`
- Better Auth server handler from `AU03-Mount-BetterAuth-Handler.md`
- SvelteKit routing system and load functions
- Existing route structure from `A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md`

### Implementation Components
1. **Server-Side Route Guards**:
   - Create `+layout.server.ts` files for protected route groups
   - Use session data from `event.locals.session` and `event.locals.user` (populated by server hook)
   - Implement session validation using Better Auth server methods
   - Return proper redirect responses for unauthenticated requests
   - Handle session data serialization for client hydration

2. **Client-Side Route Guards**:
   - Create `+layout.ts` files with authentication checks
   - Use reactive stores from Better Auth Svelte client (nano-store based)
   - Implement reactive session monitoring that automatically updates on state changes
   - Handle client-side redirects and loading states
   - Maintain authentication state consistency across client and server

3. **Route Organization**:
   - Group protected routes under common parent directories
   - Use nested layouts for shared protection logic
   - Implement route-specific authorization if needed
   - Support both `/account` and future `/dashboard` routes

### Database Changes
None required - utilizes existing Better Auth session tables

### API Changes
None required - utilizes existing Better Auth authentication endpoints

### Environment Variables
None additional required - uses existing Better Auth configuration

## Prerequisites
- `AU02-BetterAuth-Init.md` - Better Auth server configuration
- `AU03-Mount-BetterAuth-Handler.md` - Authentication API endpoints
- `AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md` - Better Auth client setup
- `A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md` - Basic route structure
- `L01-Login-Route.md` - Login page for redirects

## Integration Points
- Must work with upcoming account pages (`D01-Account-Route.md`, `D02-Account-Overview.md`)
- Should support future dashboard routes and admin areas
- Must integrate with session persistence from `AU06-Session-Persistence.md`
- Should work with existing navigation from `A02-Create-Layout-Component.md`

## Success Criteria
1. Unauthenticated users cannot access `/account/*` routes
2. Authentication redirects preserve intended destination
3. Loading states prevent authentication UI flash
4. Session expiration properly redirects to login
5. Client and server-side protection work consistently
6. No security vulnerabilities in redirect handling
7. Performance requirements met for authentication checks
8. Works seamlessly with existing Better Auth setup
