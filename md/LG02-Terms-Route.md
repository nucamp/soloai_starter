## Additional Context for AI Assistant

The `/terms` route should follow the same patterns established in the privacy route (LG01-Privacy-Route.md) while providing comprehensive terms of service content. This is a critical legal page that protects the SaaS business and informs users of their rights and responsibilities.

Key considerations:
- **Legal Compliance**: Terms must cover essential SaaS legal requirements including user accounts, payments, intellectual property, liability limitations, and dispute resolution
- **Consistency**: Match the design and navigation patterns from the privacy page for familiar user experience
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for legal document accessibility requirements
- **Future Integration**: Structure content to support upcoming payment integration features (Stripe/LemonSqueezy terms)
- **Internationalization**: Support multilingual legal content while ensuring legal validity in target markets

The implementation should create `src/routes/terms/+page.svelte` with proper SEO optimization, mobile responsiveness, and integration with the existing component ecosystem. Content should be comprehensive enough for a production SaaS application while remaining readable and user-friendly.
