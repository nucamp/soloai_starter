# Create Homepage Content in Strapi

## IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
All content type setup and modification must be performed exclusively through the official Strapi interfaces:
- Strapi Admin UI (Content-Type Builder)
- Strapi REST API
- Strapi CLI
- Strapi Client

Directly injecting code, editing source files, or programmatically manipulating the Strapi application files or codebase to create or modify content types is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

This restriction ensures:
- Database consistency and schema integrity
- Future compatibility with Strapi updates and plugins
- Maintainability and ease of troubleshooting
- Full support for localization, validation, and permissions features

Do NOT create or modify content types by editing model files, configuration files, or the database directly. Use only the UI/UX, official REST API, or CLI commands documented by Strapi.
If actions are required using the UI, ask the user to perform them through the Strapi Admin interface or provide instructions for using the Strapi CLI.
