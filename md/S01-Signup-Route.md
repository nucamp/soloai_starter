# S01-Signup-Route.md

## Overview
Create `/signup` route using SvelteKit file-based routing to enable new user registration with Better Auth integration. This route provides the foundation for user onboarding and connects to the existing authentication system established in previous lessons.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature

**Business Value**: Enable new users to create accounts and access the SaaS application, supporting business growth through user acquisition.

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a potential user, I want to access a dedicated signup page so that I can create a new account
- As a potential user, I want to be redirected away from signup if I'm already logged in so that I don't create duplicate accounts
- As a potential user, I want to navigate to login if I already have an account so that I can access my existing account
- As a potential user, I want the signup page in my preferred language so that I can understand the registration process

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, centered signup form layout using DaisyUI components
- Mobile-first responsive design maintaining usability across all screen sizes
- Consistent branding and visual hierarchy matching login page design
- Clear call-to-action for account creation with secondary action to switch to login
- Loading states and visual feedback during form interaction
- Accessible design following WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/signup` via direct URL or signup links from other pages
2. System checks authentication status using Better Auth client
3. If authenticated: redirect to `/account` to prevent duplicate registration
4. If not authenticated: display signup form with email/password fields and social options
5. User completes registration â†’ redirect to intended destination or `/account`

### Functional Requirements
- **Route Creation**: Create `/signup` route at `src/routes/signup/+page.svelte`
- **Authentication Check**: Verify user authentication status on page load
- **Redirect Logic**: Redirect authenticated users to `/account` route automatically
- **Layout Integration**: Use main layout component for consistent header/footer
- **Language Support**: Support internationalization for English, Spanish, and French
- **URL Parameters**: Handle `?redirect` query parameter for post-signup navigation
- **Accessibility**: Implement proper heading hierarchy, focus management, and keyboard navigation

### Data Requirements
- No new database models required - leverages existing Better Auth user tables
- Authentication state from Better Auth client context
- Redirect URL validation and sanitization for security
- Language preference detection and storage

### Security Considerations
- Input validation for redirect URLs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities
- CSRF protection through Better Auth integration
- Secure handling of authentication state and session management
- Rate limiting considerations for signup attempts (handled by Better Auth)

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Authentication check and redirect within 100ms for authenticated users
- Form interaction response time under 50ms
- Memory usage under 10MB for route component

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Existing Code**: 
  - Main layout component from `A02-Create-Layout-Component.md`
  - Better Auth client setup from `AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md`  
  - Paraglide i18n configuration from `PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md`
  - Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI from `A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md`
- **External Services**: Better Auth authentication system
- **npm packages**: No additional packages required beyond existing setup

### Database Changes
- No database changes required - uses existing Better Auth user schema

### API Changes  
- No new API endpoints required - uses existing Better Auth handlers from `AU03-Mount-BetterAuth-Handler.md`

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required - uses existing Better Auth configuration

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **File Structure**: Create `src/routes/signup/+page.svelte` following SvelteKit routing conventions
2. **Authentication Integration**: Use Better Auth client from global context for session checking
3. **Styling Approach**: Use Tailwind CSS classes with DaisyUI form components for consistency
4. **Internationalization**: Implement translation keys following established Paraglide patterns
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints and touch targets

### Integration Points
- **Login Route**: Include navigation link to `/login` for existing users
- **Account Route**: Redirect destination for authenticated users  
- **Signup Form**: Foundation for form component in next feature `S02-Signup-Form.md`
- **Route Guards**: Prepare for route protection implementation in `AU05-Protect-Routes.md`

### Translation Keys Required
```
signup.title
signup.heading  
signup.description
signup.form.title
signup.already.have.account
signup.login.link
auth.redirecting
meta.signup.title
meta.signup.description
```

### Content Areas
- Page title and meta information
- Main heading and description text
- Signup form container area
- Navigation links to login page
- Footer with legal/policy links (inherited from layout)

### Accessibility Requirements
- Proper HTML semantic structure with main content landmark
- Descriptive page title in `<svelte:head>`
- Heading hierarchy starting with h1
- Skip navigation support through layout component
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px target size)
- Readable text at mobile viewport sizes
- Proper viewport meta tag handling
- Fast loading on mobile networks
- Swipe-friendly interactions

Remember: This route provides the foundation for user registration but does not include the actual signup form implementation - that will be handled in the next feature `S02-Signup-Form.md`. Focus on creating a solid route structure with proper authentication checking and redirect logic.
