# LS04-LemonSqueezy-Webhooks.md

## Overview
Handle LemonSqueezy webhook events from hosted checkout completions and subscription lifecycle to maintain user billing status synchronization. Process events from LemonSqueezy's merchant of record service to update subscription status in real-time.

**Business Value**: Ensures subscription data remains synchronized between LemonSqueezy's hosted checkout system and the application, automating billing operations and access control.

**Feature Type**: Technical Integration

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Checkout Events**: Process order_created when users complete hosted checkout
- **Subscription Events**: Handle subscription_created, subscription_updated, subscription_cancelled
- **Payment Events**: Process subscription_payment_success for renewals
- **Customer Portal Events**: Handle changes made through LemonSqueezy's customer portal
- **Signature Verification**: Validate all webhooks using LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- **Idempotency**: Prevent duplicate processing using event IDs
- **Real-time Updates**: Update subscription status immediately after checkout completion
- **Audit Logging**: Track all webhook events and processing results

### Data Requirements
- **Database Schema Extensions**: Add subscription-related fields to user table: lemon_squeezy_customer_id, subscription_status, subscription_tier, subscription_end_date, lemon_squeezy_subscription_id
- **Webhook Events Table**: Create table to track processed events with fields: id, event_id, event_type, processed_at, status, user_id, error_message
- **Subscription History**: Create table for audit trail with fields: id, user_id, previous_status, new_status, previous_tier, new_tier, changed_at, event_type
- **Data Validation**: Ensure subscription status values match expected enum: active, past_due, cancelled, trialing, expired, on_hold

### Security Considerations
- **Signature Verification**: Validate all webhook requests using HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with webhook secret
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement webhook endpoint rate limiting to prevent abuse (500 requests per minute)
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all webhook payload data before database operations
- **Error Logging**: Log security events including invalid signatures and suspicious webhook activity
- **IP Validation**: Optional whitelist LemonSqueezy webhook IP addresses for additional security

### Performance Requirements
- **Processing Speed**: Process webhook events within 10 seconds under normal conditions
- **Concurrent Handling**: Support up to 100 simultaneous webhook events without performance degradation
- **Database Updates**: Complete subscription status updates within 5 seconds
- **Error Recovery**: Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed database operations
- **Memory Usage**: Webhook processing should not exceed 100MB memory per request
