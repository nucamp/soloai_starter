# Homepage Features Preview

## Overview
Create a dynamic features preview section on the homepage that showcases 3-5 key product features fetched from Strapi CMS with full multilingual support. This section serves as a compelling overview of product capabilities to drive user engagement and conversions.

**Feature type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a visitor, I want to quickly understand the key product features so that I can evaluate if this solution meets my needs
- As a marketing manager, I want to showcase our best features prominently so that we can improve conversion rates
- As a content creator, I want to manage feature content through Strapi so that I can update messaging without developer involvement
- As an international user, I want to see features in my preferred language so that I can better understand the product value

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, grid-based layout displaying 3-5 features in responsive cards
- Desktop: 3-column grid layout with equal height cards
- Tablet: 2-column grid with proper spacing
- Mobile: Single column stacked layout
- Each feature card includes icon/illustration, title, description, and optional CTA
- Visual hierarchy with consistent typography and spacing using DaisyUI components
- Smooth loading states with skeleton cards while content loads
- Hover effects and subtle animations for enhanced interactivity

### User Flow
1. User visits homepage and scrolls to features section
2. Features load dynamically from Strapi in user's selected language
3. User sees 3-5 key features with compelling descriptions
4. User can click feature cards for more details (future enhancement)
5. User proceeds to signup/pricing based on feature appeal

### Functional Requirements
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Fetch features from Strapi `/api/features` endpoint with server-side rendering
- **Content Filtering**: Display only published features marked as "homepage" or with highest priority
- **Multilingual Support**: Render features in English, Spanish, or French based on Paraglide locale
- **Fallback Handling**: Show default English content if translations unavailable
- **Rich Text Processing**: Support formatted descriptions with HTML sanitization
- **Responsive Design**: Maintain readability and usability across all screen sizes
- **Performance**: Features section loads within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper heading hierarchy and alt text

### Data Requirements
- Integrate with existing Strapi Features content type from SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md
- Required Strapi fields: name, shortDescription, category, priority, icon, published status
- Support i18n locale variants (en, es, fr) from AI02-Content-Localization-Workflow.md
- Optional fields: longDescription, benefits array, ctaText, ctaUrl
- Filter features by published status and homepage display flag
- Sort features by priority order for consistent display

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize all rich text content from Strapi to prevent XSS attacks
- Validate feature data structure before rendering
- Handle API failures gracefully without exposing error details
- Use public Strapi API permissions from SP04-Strapi-API-Permissions.md

### Performance Requirements
- Feature content loads within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Images lazy load with proper placeholder states
- Cache Strapi responses with appropriate headers
- Language switching updates content within 500ms
- Support up to 10 features without performance degradation

### Content Structure

### Design Consistency
- Use DaisyUI card components with consistent spacing and styling
