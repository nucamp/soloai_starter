This feature integrates with existing Strapi CMS content and implements search functionality to help users quickly find answers to common questions.

**Feature type**: User-Facing Feature

**Business value**: Reduces customer support workload by providing self-service options while improving user experience through instant access to common answers.

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a potential customer, I want to browse FAQ items so that I can find answers to common questions before contacting support
- As a user with a specific question, I want to search FAQ content so that I can quickly find relevant answers
- As a customer, I want to filter FAQ by category so that I can focus on topics relevant to my situation
- As a mobile user, I want FAQ items to be expandable/collapsible so that I can easily navigate content on small screens

### UI/UX Requirements

- Each FAQ item displays question prominently with expandable answer content
- Mobile-first responsive design with touch-friendly expand/collapse interactions
- Loading states with skeleton cards during content fetch
- Empty state message when no FAQ items match search criteria

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/contact` page
2. User scrolls to FAQ section below contact form
3. User can search FAQ items using search input with real-time filtering
4. User can filter by category using tab navigation
5. User clicks on FAQ question to expand/collapse answer content
6. User can navigate between multiple FAQ items with smooth animations

### Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- FAQ section loads within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Search results display within 200ms of user input
- FAQ expand/collapse animations complete within 300ms
- Client-side caching reduces API calls for repeated FAQ access

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Existing Strapi CMS with FAQ content type (SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md)

- Paraglide i18n system (PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md)
- Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components (A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md)
- Main layout component (A02-Create-Layout-Component.md)

### Component Architecture
- Create `ContactFAQ.svelte` component in `src/lib/components/contact/` directory
- Create `FAQItem.svelte` component for individual FAQ items with expand/collapse
- Create `FAQSearch.svelte` component for search input and filtering
- Create `FAQCategoryTabs.svelte` component for category filtering
- Integrate components into existing `/contact` route structure

### API Integration

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

This feature builds upon the existing contact page infrastructure and integrates with the established Strapi CMS content management system. The FAQ section provides self-service support options while maintaining consistency with the overall application design.

**Key Integration Points**:
- Extends the contact route created in CT01-Contact-Route.md
- Uses FAQ content from Strapi setup completed in SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md and SP03-Strapi-Seed-Content.md
- Follows established component patterns from other page implementations
- Integrates with Paraglide i18n for multilingual support

**Design Considerations**:
- FAQ section should visually separate from contact form while maintaining page flow
- Search and category filtering should work together seamlessly
- Mobile users need easy access to FAQ content without cluttered interface
- FAQ answers may contain rich text content requiring proper sanitization

**Performance Optimization**:
- Implement client-side caching to reduce repeated API calls
- Use debouncing for search input to prevent excessive requests
- Consider virtual scrolling if FAQ list becomes very long
- Optimize FAQ content loading with skeleton states

This feature completes the customer support experience by providing comprehensive self-service options alongside the direct contact form, reducing support ticket volume while improving user satisfaction.
