# S03-Signup-Validation.md

## Overview
Implement comprehensive UX validation and inline feedback for the signup form to enhance user experience with real-time field validation, clear error messaging, and visual feedback during registration. This ensures users receive immediate guidance when entering invalid data and understand requirements before form submission.

**Feature type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to see real-time validation feedback so I can correct errors before submitting the form
- As a new user, I want clear password requirements displayed so I know what makes a strong password
- As a new user, I want to see confirmation when my email format is valid so I'm confident in my input
- As a new user, I want immediate feedback about password strength so I can create a secure account
- As a user with slow internet, I want visual indicators during form processing so I know the system is working

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Real-time field validation**: Email format validation on blur, password strength indicator with visual feedback, confirm password matching validation
- **Inline error messages**: Display below each field with red styling using DaisyUI error classes, specific error text for each validation type
- **Success indicators**: Green checkmarks or success styling for valid fields using DaisyUI success classes
- **Loading states**: Disable form during submission with spinner/loading indicator, prevent double-submission
- **Password requirements display**: Show requirements list with checkmarks as requirements are met
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Maintain usability across all screen sizes with proper touch targets
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA with proper ARIA labels, error announcements, and keyboard navigation

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/signup` page
2. User starts typing in email field → real-time format validation with visual feedback
3. User enters password → strength indicator updates with requirements checklist
4. User enters confirm password → matching validation with immediate feedback
5. Form submission → comprehensive validation check with error summary if needed
6. Success → visual confirmation before redirect to intended destination

### Functional Requirements
- **Email validation**: RFC 5322 compliant email format validation with common domain checking
- **Password strength validation**: Minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
- **Password confirmation**: Must match password field exactly with real-time comparison
- **Field-level validation**: Validate on blur for email, on input for passwords with debouncing
- **Form-level validation**: Complete validation check before Better Auth signup attempt
- **Error persistence**: Maintain validation state during form interactions and error recovery
- **Success feedback**: Clear visual confirmation of valid inputs before submission

### Data Requirements
- **Client-side validation state**: Track validation status for each field (valid, invalid, pristine, touched)
- **Error message storage**: Maintain specific error messages for each validation type
- **Password strength metrics**: Calculate and display strength score with visual indicator
- **Form submission state**: Track loading, success, and error states during registration process

### Security Considerations
- **Input sanitization**: Sanitize all form inputs before validation and submission
- **XSS prevention**: Escape user input in error messages and validation feedback
- **Rate limiting awareness**: Handle Better Auth rate limiting gracefully with user feedback
- **Password visibility toggle**: Secure implementation of show/hide password functionality
- **Validation bypass prevention**: Ensure server-side validation in Better Auth regardless of client validation

### Performance Requirements
- **Validation response time**: Field validation feedback within 100ms of user input
- **Debouncing**: Password strength calculation debounced to 300ms to prevent excessive processing
- **Memory usage**: Validation state management under 5MB memory footprint
- **Mobile performance**: Smooth validation feedback on devices with limited processing power

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Existing Better Auth client**: From AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md for signup integration
- **DaisyUI components**: Form inputs, error/success styling, loading indicators
- **Svelte reactivity**: For real-time validation state management and UI updates
- **Validation libraries**: Consider zod or joi for schema-based validation with TypeScript support
- **Paraglide i18n**: For translating validation messages and error text

### Integration Points
- **Better Auth signup form**: Enhance existing form from S02-Signup-Form.md with validation layer
- **Layout component**: Use main layout from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md for consistent styling
- **Error handling**: Integrate with Better Auth error responses and network failure handling
- **Redirect functionality**: Maintain existing redirect parameter handling from signup route
- **Language switching**: Ensure validation messages update when user changes language

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required (uses existing Better Auth configuration)

### Validation Rules Implementation
- **Email validation**: Use HTML5 email type with additional regex validation for common formats
- **Password strength**: Implement scoring algorithm with visual progress indicator (weak/fair/good/strong)
- **Confirm password**: Real-time comparison with password field using Svelte reactive statements
- **Required fields**: Mark all fields as required with proper ARIA attributes and visual indicators
- **Custom validation messages**: Provide specific, actionable feedback for each validation failure type

### Accessibility Implementation
- **ARIA live regions**: Announce validation changes to screen readers
- **Error associations**: Use aria-describedby to link errors with form fields
- **Focus management**: Maintain logical tab order with validation feedback
- **Color contrast**: Ensure error/success colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- **Keyboard navigation**: Support all validation interactions via keyboard

### Performance Optimization
- **Debounced validation**: Prevent excessive validation calls during rapid typing
- **Memoized calculations**: Cache password strength calculations for identical inputs
- **Efficient re-rendering**: Use Svelte's fine-grained reactivity to minimize DOM updates
- **Lazy validation**: Only validate fields after user interaction (touched state)

## Prerequisites
- AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md (Better Auth client configuration)
- S01-Signup-Route.md (Signup route implementation)
- S02-Signup-Form.md (Basic signup form structure)
- A02-Create-Layout-Component.md (Main layout component)
- A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md (Styling framework setup)
- PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md (Internationalization support)

## Next Steps
After completing this validation implementation, the signup form will be ready for:
- AU05-Protect-Routes.md (Route protection middleware)
- AU06-Session-Persistence.md (Session management)
- MA02-Mautic-API-Auth.md (Marketing automation integration)
