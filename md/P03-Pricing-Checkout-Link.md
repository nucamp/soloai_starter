# P03-Pricing-Checkout-Link.md

## Overview
Create "Subscribe" or "Choose Plan" buttons for each pricing tier that prepare for future payment integration with Stripe and LemonSqueezy. This feature establishes the user interface foundation for checkout flows while maintaining a seamless experience for users ready to purchase subscriptions.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature

**Business Value**: Enables conversion from pricing page to subscription signup, preparing the critical path for revenue generation while maintaining professional appearance during development phase.

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a visitor viewing pricing tiers, I want to see clear "Choose Plan" buttons so I can easily initiate the subscription process
- As a potential customer, I want different button states based on my authentication status so I know what action I need to take
- As an authenticated user, I want to see appropriate messaging if I already have a subscription to avoid confusion
- As a user on mobile, I want touch-friendly buttons that work consistently across all devices

### UI/UX Requirements
**Button Design**:
- Primary CTA button using DaisyUI `btn-primary` class for paid plans
- Secondary/outline button using DaisyUI `btn-outline` for free tier
- Minimum 44px height for touch targets on mobile devices
- Loading states with spinner and disabled appearance during processing
- Visual emphasis on recommended/popular plans with enhanced button styling

**Button Text Variations**:
- Free tier: "Get Started Free" 
- Paid tiers: "Choose [Plan Name]" or "Subscribe to [Plan Name]"
- Authenticated users with existing subscription: "Current Plan" (disabled) or "Upgrade"
- Loading state: "Processing..." with spinner icon

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Full-width buttons on mobile (<768px)
- Fixed-width buttons on tablet and desktop
- Consistent spacing and alignment within pricing cards
- Hover effects on desktop with smooth transitions

### User Flow
1. User views pricing page with tier cards
2. User clicks "Choose Plan" button for desired tier
3. System checks authentication status using Better Auth client
4. **Guest users**: Redirect to `/signup?plan=[tier-id]&redirect=/checkout` to create account first
5. **Authenticated users**: Redirect to `/checkout?plan=[tier-id]` for payment processing
6. Show loading state during redirect with disabled button
7. Handle errors gracefully with retry options

### Functional Requirements

**Authentication Integration**:
- Check user session status using Better Auth client from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md
- Dynamically render button text and behavior based on login state
- Preserve plan selection through authentication flow using URL parameters
- Handle session changes reactively to update button states

**Plan Parameter Handling**:
- Pass pricing tier identifier in URL parameters for checkout flow
- Validate plan IDs against available Strapi pricing tiers
- Support both tier names and IDs for flexible integration
- Sanitize URL parameters to prevent injection attacks

**Error Handling**:
- Display user-friendly error messages for network failures
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed authentication checks
- Handle invalid plan IDs with fallback to pricing page
- Log errors for debugging without exposing sensitive data

**Performance Requirements**:
- Button interactions must respond within 100ms
- Authentication checks complete within 200ms
- Page redirects occur within 500ms
- Loading states appear immediately on button click

### Data Requirements

**Pricing Tier Integration**:
- Connect to existing Strapi "Pricing Tier" content type from P02-Pricing-Tiers.md
- Use tier `id` or `slug` field for plan identification
- Support tier metadata like `isPopular`, `isRecommended` for button styling
- Handle tier availability and feature flags

**URL Parameter Structure**:
```
/signup?plan=pro&redirect=/checkout
/checkout?plan=enterprise
```

**Button State Management**:
- Track loading states per button to prevent multiple clicks
- Cache authentication status with 30-second TTL
- Maintain button states during navigation transitions

### Security Considerations

**Parameter Validation**:
- Validate plan parameters against available tiers from Strapi
- Sanitize all URL parameters to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limit button clicks to prevent abuse (max 5 per minute per user)

**Authentication Security**:
- Use secure redirect URL validation to prevent open redirects
- Ensure authentication state checks are server-verified
- Protect against session fixation attacks
- Never expose sensitive subscription data in URL parameters

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Better Auth client for authentication status (AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md)
- Strapi pricing tier data (P02-Pricing-Tiers.md)
- DaisyUI button components (A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md)
- SvelteKit routing and navigation
- Paraglide i18n for button text localization (PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md)

### Component Architecture
- Extend existing pricing tier cards with interactive button component
- Create reusable `PricingButton.svelte` component for consistent behavior
- Integrate with `PricingTierCard.svelte` from P02-Pricing-Tiers.md
- Support button customization through props (tier, variant, size)

### Integration Points
- Pricing page layout component integration
- Authentication state from Better Auth global context
- Future Stripe/LemonSqueezy checkout flow endpoints
- Mautic lead tracking for conversion funnel analysis

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required - uses existing authentication and CMS configurations.

### Database Changes
No database schema changes required - builds on existing Strapi pricing tier content type.

### API Changes
No new API endpoints required - prepares for future checkout API implementation.

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

### Implementation Approach
This feature creates the user interface foundation for subscription conversion without implementing actual payment processing. The buttons should be fully functional for user experience while gracefully handling the transition to future payment integration.

### Future Integration Preparation
The button implementation should anticipate integration with:
- ST03-Stripe-Checkout-Sessions.md (Week 3) for Stripe payment processing  
- LS03-LemonSqueezy-Checkout-URLs.md (Week 3) for international payments
- Subscription management workflows in account dashboard

### Translation Requirements
Button text and loading messages must support English, Spanish, and French localization using the established Paraglide system. Error messages should also be internationalized for consistent user experience.

### Accessibility Standards
Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper focus management, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast for all button states.

### Mobile Optimization
Priority on mobile-first design with touch-friendly interactions, appropriate button sizing, and smooth loading states that work reliably on slower mobile connections.
