# D05-Account-Logout.md

## Overview
- Implement logout functionality for authenticated users to securely terminate their session and clear authentication state
- Business value: Provides secure session management and meets security best practices for user account control
- Feature type: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As an authenticated user, I want to logout of my account so that my session is securely terminated
- As a user sharing a device, I want to logout so that others cannot access my account
- As a security-conscious user, I want immediate session termination so that my data remains protected

### UI/UX Requirements
- Logout button prominently displayed in account dashboard and navigation header
- Logout button uses DaisyUI secondary or ghost button styling with clear "Logout" text
- Loading state during logout process with disabled button and spinner indicator
- Confirmation message or redirect to login page after successful logout
- Mobile-first responsive design with 44px minimum touch target height
- Consistent with existing button styling from account overview and navigation components

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Logout" button from account dashboard or navigation menu
2. Better Auth client initiates logout process with loading indicator
3. Session is terminated and authentication state is cleared
4. User is redirected to login page or homepage with success message
5. All browser tabs/windows are synchronized to reflect logged-out state

### Functional Requirements
- Integrate with Better Auth client `signOut` method from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md
- Clear all authentication state including JWT tokens, session data, and cached user information
- Redirect user to `/login` route after successful logout with optional success message
- Synchronize logout across all browser tabs using session persistence from AU06-Session-Persistence.md
- Handle logout errors gracefully with retry options and fallback mechanisms
- Prevent double-clicking logout button during processing
- Clear any locally cached user data or preferences
- Trigger immediate update of authentication-dependent UI components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logout button calls Better Auth client `signOut()` method successfully
- Session is terminated within 2 seconds of logout initiation
- User is redirected to appropriate page after logout
- Authentication state is cleared across all application components
- Cross-tab logout synchronization works correctly
- Loading states prevent multiple logout attempts
- Error handling provides clear feedback to user

### Data Requirements
- No additional data storage required
- Clear existing session data and authentication tokens
- Remove any cached user profile information
- Maintain logout audit trail in server logs for security monitoring

### Security Considerations
- Ensure complete session termination on server-side
- Clear all client-side authentication tokens and sensitive data
- Prevent session fixation attacks by fully invalidating session
- Log logout events for security auditing purposes
- Ensure logout works even if server is temporarily unavailable
- Protect against CSRF attacks during logout process

### Performance Requirements
- Logout process must complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- Loading indicator appears within 100ms of button click
- Cross-tab synchronization propagates within 50ms
- Redirect to destination page occurs within 500ms of successful logout

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies

- SvelteKit navigation and routing system
- Session persistence system from AU06-Session-Persistence.md
- Main layout component from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md
- DaisyUI button components and styling

### Database Changes
- No database schema changes required
- Server-side session invalidation handled by Better Auth

### API Changes
- Uses existing Better Auth logout endpoints from AU03-Mount-BetterAuth-Handler.md
- No new API endpoints required

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Uses existing Better Auth configuration

## Implementation Context

### Prerequisites

- AU06-Session-Persistence.md: Session synchronization across browser tabs
- D01-Account-Route.md: Account route structure and authentication guards
- D02-Account-Overview.md: Account dashboard layout and components
- A02-Create-Layout-Component.md: Main layout with navigation header

### Integration Points
- Account dashboard from D02-Account-Overview.md displays logout button
- Navigation header includes logout option for authenticated users
- Route protection system from AU05-Protect-Routes.md handles post-logout redirects
- Session management integrates with existing authentication state

### Component Structure

  - `account.logout` - "Logout" button text
  - `account.loggingOut` - "Logging out..." loading text
  - `account.logoutSuccess` - "Successfully logged out" confirmation
  - `account.logoutError` - "Logout failed. Please try again."

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper button labeling
- Keyboard navigation support with Enter and Space key activation
- Screen reader announcements for logout state changes
- High contrast support and focus indicators
- Clear visual feedback during loading and error states
