# Page Transitions

## Overview
Add simple page transitions between routes to enhance user experience with smooth navigation animations. This feature provides visual continuity during route changes and creates a more polished, professional feel throughout the SaaS application.

**Feature type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a user, I want smooth visual transitions when navigating between pages so that the interface feels polished and responsive
- As a user, I want consistent animation behavior across all routes so that the experience feels cohesive
- As a user, I want transitions that don't slow down navigation so that the app remains fast and responsive

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Transition Types**: Implement subtle fade or slide transitions between page changes
- **Animation Duration**: Keep transitions between 200-300ms for optimal perceived performance
- **Loading States**: Show transition animations while new page content loads
- **Accessibility**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users who prefer minimal animations
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure transitions perform smoothly on mobile devices with 60fps
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Maintain focus management during transitions for keyboard navigation

### User Flow
1. User clicks navigation link or button
2. Current page begins fade/slide out animation
3. New page content loads during transition
4. New page fades/slides in with smooth animation
5. Focus moves appropriately for accessibility
6. User can immediately interact with new page

### Functional Requirements
- **Route Transition Animation**: Smooth transitions between all major routes (/, /features, /pricing, /contact, /account, etc.)
- **Authentication-Aware Transitions**: Different transition styles for public vs protected routes
- **Loading Integration**: Coordinate with existing loading states from Strapi content fetching
- **Performance Optimization**: Transitions must not block navigation or degrade performance
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and maintain focus management

### Data Requirements
- No new database tables or API endpoints required
- Extend existing route structure with transition metadata
- Cache transition preferences in localStorage for user customization

### Security Considerations
- Transitions must not expose sensitive information during route changes
- Ensure transitions don't interfere with authentication redirects
- Validate transition parameters to prevent injection attacks

### Performance Requirements
- Transition animations must run at 60fps on modern devices
- Total transition time must not exceed 300ms
- Page transitions should not increase route change time by more than 100ms
- Support simultaneous transitions for up to 10 concurrent users without performance degradation

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Existing Dependencies**: SvelteKit routing system, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI components
- **Animation Library**: Consider `@tailwindcss/typography` for enhanced animations or native CSS transitions
- **Motion Libraries**: Optional integration with `framer-motion` or `svelte/motion` for advanced animations

### Database Changes
- No database modifications required
- Optional: Add user_preferences table field for transition settings

### API Changes
- No new API endpoints required
- Consider adding transition preferences to existing user settings endpoints

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Optional: `PUBLIC_ENABLE_TRANSITIONS=true` for feature flagging

## Integration Points

### Completed Dependencies
- **A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md**: Build upon existing route structure and navigation
- **A02-Create-Layout-Component.md**: Integrate with main layout component for consistent transitions
- **A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md**: Use existing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI styling system
- **A06-Nav-Menu.md**: Coordinate with navigation menu for trigger points
- **PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md**: Ensure transitions work with language switching
- **AU05-Protect-Routes.md**: Handle transitions with authentication redirects appropriately

### Integration with Better Auth
- Coordinate transitions with authentication state changes
- Handle protected route redirects smoothly
- Maintain transition continuity during login/logout flows

### Integration with Strapi Content
- Coordinate transitions with content loading states
- Ensure smooth transitions while fetching translated content
- Handle error states during content loading gracefully

### Integration with Internationalization
- Ensure transitions work seamlessly with language changes
- Coordinate with Paraglide locale switching
- Maintain transition consistency across different language content

## Accessibility Considerations
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for users with vestibular disorders
- Maintain proper focus management during route transitions
- Ensure screen reader compatibility with route change announcements
- Provide skip links that work correctly during transitions
- Test with keyboard-only navigation to ensure transitions don't break accessibility

## Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers with CSS transitions and transforms
- Graceful degradation for older browsers without transition support
- Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Ensure mobile browser compatibility (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Optimization
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout-affecting properties for better performance
- Implement GPU acceleration with `transform3d` or `will-change` properties
- Lazy load transition effects to reduce initial bundle size
- Monitor Core Web Vitals impact and ensure transitions don't affect LCP/FID scores

## Future Considerations
- Integration points for upcoming deployment and production features
- Extensibility for more complex page transition patterns
- Support for route-specific transition customization
- Analytics integration to track user engagement with transitions
