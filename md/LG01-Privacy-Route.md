## Additional Context for AI Assistant

### SaaS Application Context
This privacy policy page is part of a SaaS application built with:
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components
- **CMS**: Optional Strapi integration for content management
- **i18n**: Paraglide for multilingual support
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (referenced in privacy policy content)
- **Database**: MySQL (referenced in data collection practices)

### Content Requirements
The privacy policy must address:
- Personal information collection (email, name, profile data)
- Authentication data handling (Better Auth integration)
- Payment information processing (future Stripe/LemonSqueezy integration)
- Cookie usage and session management
- Third-party service integrations (OpenAI, Mautic, Strapi)
- User rights under GDPR and CCPA
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Contact information for privacy inquiries

### Integration Points
- **Layout**: Use existing main layout component with header/footer
- **Navigation**: Integrate with footer links from H05-Homepage-Footer.md
- **i18n**: Translation keys should follow existing Paraglide patterns
- **Styling**: Consistent with legal page styling patterns
- **Future**: Consider integration with upcoming `/terms` route for consistent legal page experience

### Prerequisites
- A02-Create-Layout-Component.md: Main layout component with header/footer
- PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md: Multilingual support configuration
- A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md: Styling framework setup
- A04-SEO-Meta-Config.md: SEO meta tags configuration
- H05-Homepage-Footer.md: Footer navigation links

### Performance Considerations
- Static content loads faster than dynamic Strapi content
- Consider lazy loading table of contents on mobile
- Optimize typography for reading comprehension
- Implement smooth scroll behavior for section navigation

The implementation should create a professional, legally compliant privacy policy page that maintains consistency with the existing application design and supports the multilingual user base.
