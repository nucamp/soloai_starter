# Features Route Setup

## Overview
- Create a comprehensive `/features` route to showcase all product capabilities with dynamic content from Strapi CMS
- Establish the primary product information page with multilingual support and professional presentation
- Feature type: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a potential customer, I want to view all product features so that I can understand the complete value proposition
- As a visitor, I want to see features in my preferred language so that I can better understand the product
- As a user on mobile, I want a responsive feature listing so that I can browse features on any device
- As a marketing team member, I want to manage feature content through Strapi so that I can update product information without developer involvement

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, professional features page layout using DaisyUI components with consistent branding
- Hero section with page title, subtitle, and optional CTA matching homepage design patterns
- Feature grid layout: 3 columns on desktop (1024px+), 2 columns on tablet (768px-1023px), single column on mobile (<768px)
- Each feature card includes icon/illustration, title, description, category badge, and optional "Learn More" link
- Category filtering tabs or dropdown to organize features by type (Core, Advanced, Integration, Security)
- Search functionality with real-time filtering of features by title and description
- Smooth hover effects and loading states with skeleton cards during content fetch
- Mobile-first responsive design with minimum 44px touch targets
- Proper visual hierarchy with feature importance indicated through card styling or positioning

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/features` from main navigation or homepage
2. Page loads with hero section and feature grid displayed
3. User can filter features by category using tab navigation
4. User can search features using search input field
5. User clicks individual feature cards for detailed information
6. Page adapts to selected language without reload

## Functional Requirements

### Dynamic Content Integration
- **Strapi Content Fetching**: Retrieve all published features from `/api/features` endpoint with server-side rendering
- **Multilingual Support**: Display features in English (default), Spanish (es), or French (fr) based on Paraglide locale
- **Content Fallback**: Show English content when translations unavailable with graceful degradation
- **Rich Text Processing**: Safely render feature descriptions with HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

### Feature Organization
- **Category Filtering**: Filter features by category (Core, Advanced, Integration, Security) with tab navigation
- **Priority Ordering**: Display features sorted by priority field from Strapi with featured items first
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search filtering by feature title and description text
- **Publication Status**: Only display features marked as published in Strapi CMS

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load Time**: Complete page render within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Content Loading**: Strapi API response and processing within 1 second
- **Search Performance**: Real-time search results within 200ms of user input
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy load feature images with WebP format support

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/features` route accessible via direct URL navigation and main site navigation
- [ ] All published features from Strapi display in responsive grid layout
- [ ] Category filtering works with smooth transitions between filtered views
- [ ] Search functionality filters features in real-time without page reload
- [ ] Features display in user's selected language with English fallback
- [ ] Mobile layout provides optimal browsing experience on 320px+ viewports
- [ ] Loading states appear during content fetch with skeleton UI
- [ ] Error handling displays fallback content when Strapi unavailable

## Data Requirements

### Strapi Content Structure
- **Feature Content Type**: Use existing Feature content type from SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md
- **Required Fields**: name, description, category, priority, published status, localization data
- **Optional Fields**: icon/image, benefits list, CTA configuration, detailed description
- **Categories**: Core Features, Advanced Features, Integrations, Security & Compliance

### Content Validation
- **Feature Names**: 50 characters maximum for consistent card layout
- **Descriptions**: 150 characters for preview, unlimited for detailed view
- **Categories**: Predefined enum values to ensure consistency
- **Images**: Support PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG formats up to 2MB per image

## Security Considerations
- **Content Sanitization**: Sanitize all rich text content from Strapi to prevent XSS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Validate search queries and filter parameters to prevent injection
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement search request throttling to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensure proper CORS headers for Strapi API requests

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Existing Integrations**: Strapi CMS connection from SP05-Strapi-Frontend-Connect.md
- **Internationalization**: Paraglide i18n system from PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md
- **Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI from A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md
- **Layout System**: Main layout component from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md
- **SEO Configuration**: Meta tags system from A04-SEO-Meta-Config.md

### Database Changes
- **No Schema Changes**: Uses existing Feature content type and Strapi API endpoints
- **Content Requirements**: Requires feature content seeded in SP03-Strapi-Seed-Content.md

### API Integration
- **Strapi Endpoints**: GET `/api/features` with i18n locale support and filtering
- **Response Format**: Handle Strapi's nested data/attributes structure with relationships
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Strapi API unavailable

### Environment Variables
- **Existing Variables**: Uses STRAPI_API_URL and PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL from previous setup
- **No New Variables**: No additional environment configuration required
