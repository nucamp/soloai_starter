# Profile Update Form Implementation

## Overview
- Create comprehensive profile update form for authenticated users to modify their account information
- Enable users to update display name, email address, password, and other profile details through Better Auth API
- Feature type: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As an authenticated user, I want to update my display name so that my account reflects my preferred identity
- As an authenticated user, I want to change my email address so that I can use my current email for notifications
- As an authenticated user, I want to update my password so that I can maintain account security
- As an authenticated user, I want to see confirmation when my changes are saved so that I know the update was successful
- As an authenticated user, I want to see validation errors so that I can correct invalid input before submitting

### UI/UX Requirements
- Card-based form layout using DaisyUI components matching existing account dashboard design
- Form sections for Personal Information (name, email) and Security (password change)
- Inline validation with real-time feedback and error messaging
- Loading states during form submission with disabled inputs
- Success confirmation messages with auto-dismiss functionality
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper touch targets (minimum 44px height)
- Form fields pre-populated with current user data from Better Auth session

### User Flow
1. Navigate to `/account` route (requires authentication)
2. View account overview with "Edit Profile" button or link
3. Access profile update form (same page or modal/expandable section)
4. See current profile data pre-populated in form fields
5. Modify desired fields with real-time validation feedback
6. Submit form with loading state and disabled inputs
7. Receive success confirmation or error messages
8. Updated information immediately reflected in account overview

### Functional Requirements
- **Profile Data Updates**: Support updating display name, email address, and password through Better Auth API methods
- **Email Change Workflow**: Handle email verification process if email address is changed
- **Password Updates**: Require current password confirmation before allowing password change
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for email format, password strength, and required fields
- **Data Persistence**: Changes saved to Better Auth user database and session updated immediately
- **Error Handling**: Display specific error messages for validation failures, duplicate emails, and API errors
- **Security Validation**: Verify current session validity before allowing profile updates

### Acceptance Criteria
- Form pre-populates with current user data from Better Auth session
- Real-time validation for email format using RFC 5322 compliant regex
- Password strength indicator with minimum 8 character requirement
- Current password required for password changes with verification
- Email changes trigger verification workflow if supported by Better Auth
- Form submission completes within 3 seconds with loading indicators
- Success messages display for 5 seconds before auto-dismissing
- Error messages remain visible until user corrects input or manually dismisses
- Updated profile data immediately visible in account overview without page refresh
- Mobile responsiveness maintained across 320px+ viewport widths

### Data Requirements
- **User Profile Fields**: Display name (string, 1-100 characters), email (valid email format), password (minimum 8 characters)
- **Session Integration**: Read current user data from Better Auth session context
- **Validation Rules**: Email uniqueness check, password strength requirements, required field validation
- **Update Tracking**: Track last updated timestamp for profile changes

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication Required**: Valid Better Auth session required for all profile update operations
- **Current Password Verification**: Require current password confirmation for sensitive changes (email, password)
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all form inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for profile update requests (maximum 5 updates per minute)
- **CSRF Protection**: Include CSRF tokens in form submissions
- **Session Validation**: Verify session authenticity on each update request
- **Email Verification**: Trigger email verification for email address changes
- **Audit Logging**: Log all profile update attempts with timestamps and user identification

### Performance Requirements
- **Form Load Time**: Profile form must load within 1 second
- **API Response Time**: Profile updates must complete within 3 seconds
- **Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation feedback within 100ms
- **Session Updates**: Updated profile data must be available in session within 500ms

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Better Auth client and server libraries (from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md)
- Existing Better Auth session management and authentication guards
- DaisyUI components and Tailwind CSS styling (from A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md)
- Paraglide i18n system for multi-language support (from PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md)
- Form validation utilities (consider Zod or similar schema validation)

### Database Changes
- No new database tables required - uses existing Better Auth user table
- Profile updates modify existing user fields: name, email, password hash
- Better Auth handles database schema and user field management automatically

### API Changes
- Utilize existing Better Auth client methods for profile updates
- No new API endpoints required - Better Auth provides update functionality
- Integration with Better Auth session management for immediate data updates

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Uses existing Better Auth configuration from AU02-BetterAuth-Init.md

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

### Implementation Approach
1. **Component Structure**: Create profile update form as expandable section within existing account overview or as separate form component
2. **Better Auth Integration**: Use Better Auth client methods for reading current user data and submitting updates
3. **Form Management**: Implement controlled form inputs with real-time validation and loading states
4. **Error Handling**: Create comprehensive error handling for API failures, validation errors, and network issues
5. **Success Feedback**: Implement success confirmation with automatic UI updates

### Prerequisites
- AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md: Better Auth client configuration and session management
- D02-Account-Overview.md: Account dashboard layout and user data display
- A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md: Styling framework and component library
- PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md: Internationalization system for form labels and messages

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing account route protection from AU05-Protect-Routes.md
- Should update data displayed in account overview from D02-Account-Overview.md
- Must support existing internationalization patterns from Paraglide setup
- Should maintain consistency with other form components (login, signup)

### Future Considerations
- Form structure should accommodate additional profile fields that may be added later
- Consider extensibility for profile photo uploads in future features
- Prepare for potential subscription management integration in billing features
- Maintain compatibility with upcoming Mautic contact synchronization
