# Signup Form Implementation

## Overview
Build comprehensive registration form component integrating Better Auth client with email/password authentication and social OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord) to enable new user acquisition with seamless onboarding experience.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature

**Business Value**: Enables user acquisition through streamlined registration process with multiple authentication options, reducing friction for new users and supporting growth objectives.

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to register with email/password so that I can create an account quickly
- As a new user, I want to register with social providers (Google/GitHub/Discord) so that I can skip manual form filling
- As a new user, I want clear validation feedback so that I understand any registration issues
- As a new user, I want to be redirected to my intended destination after signup so that I can continue my workflow

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, centered registration form using DaisyUI components with consistent branding
- Email and password input fields with proper validation indicators
- Social authentication buttons with provider branding (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- Form validation with inline error messages below relevant fields
- Loading states during registration with disabled form submission
- Success confirmation before redirect
- Mobile-first responsive design maintaining usability across all screen sizes
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance with proper labels and keyboard navigation

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/signup` route
2. User sees registration form with email/password fields and social provider buttons
3. User either:
   - Fills out email/password and submits form, OR
   - Clicks social provider button for OAuth flow
4. System validates input and processes registration
5. User receives success confirmation
6. User is redirected to intended destination or `/account` route

### Functional Requirements
- **Email/Password Registration**: Use Better Auth client `signUp` method with email and password validation
- **Social OAuth Integration**: Support Google, GitHub, Discord OAuth flows using Better Auth social provider methods
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for email format, password strength (minimum 8 characters), and required fields
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages for registration failures, duplicate accounts, and network issues
- **Redirect Handling**: Respect `?redirect` query parameter for post-registration navigation with URL validation
- **Form State Management**: Preserve form data during error recovery, clear sensitive data on success
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators and disable form during API requests
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, focus management, and semantic HTML structure

### Data Requirements
- Form captures: email address, password, confirm password (client-side only)
- Better Auth handles: user record creation, password hashing, session establishment
- Social OAuth provides: email, name, profile data from provider APIs
- Redirect URL validation to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities

### Security Considerations
- Client-side password confirmation before submission
- Better Auth handles secure password hashing with Argon2
- CSRF protection through Better Auth client
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting handled by Better Auth server
- Secure redirect URL validation

### Performance Requirements
- Form submission processing within 3 seconds under normal conditions
- Social OAuth redirect completion within 5 seconds
- Form validation feedback within 100ms of user input
- Page load time under 2 seconds on 3G connection

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

This signup form is a critical user acquisition component that must integrate seamlessly with the existing Better Auth implementation. The form should feel native to the application while providing enterprise-grade security and user experience.

Key integration points include:
- Building upon the Better Auth client setup from `AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md`
- Using the same layout and styling patterns established in `L02-Login-Form.md`
- Following the error handling patterns from `L03-Login-Error-State.md`
- Maintaining consistency with the signup route structure from `S01-Signup-Route.md`

The implementation should create a seamless bridge between user acquisition and the onboarding flow, preparing users for integration with Mautic campaigns and the broader SaaS experience.
