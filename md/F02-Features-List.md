# Feature List Display - Features Page Implementation

## Overview
Create a comprehensive features listing component that displays all product features dynamically from Strapi CMS with multilingual support, categorization, and responsive design. This establishes the core content display for the `/features` page, showcasing product capabilities with rich visual presentation and interactive filtering.

**Business Value**: Provides potential customers with detailed product information to support purchase decisions and feature discovery
**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a potential customer, I want to browse all product features so I can understand what the product offers
- As a visitor, I want to filter features by category so I can find relevant functionality quickly
- As a non-English speaker, I want to see features in my preferred language so I can fully understand the offerings
- As a mobile user, I want an optimized feature browsing experience so I can explore features on any device

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Grid Layout**: 3-column desktop, 2-column tablet, single column mobile responsive design
- **Feature Cards**: Each card displays icon/illustration, title, description, category badge, and optional CTA
- **Category Filtering**: Interactive tabs for All, Core, Advanced, Integration, Security feature types
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search box filtering features by title and description
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Featured items display prominently at the top with enhanced styling
- **Loading States**: Skeleton cards during data fetching with smooth loading animations
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface with minimum 44px touch targets

### User Flow
1. Navigate to `/features` page → See hero section with page title and description
2. View all features in categorized grid layout → Filter by category or search
3. Click feature cards for more details → Access additional information or related resources
4. Change language → Content updates instantly without page reload
5. Browse on mobile → Optimized single-column layout with touch interactions

### Functional Requirements
- **Dynamic Content**: Fetch all features from Strapi `/api/features` endpoint with server-side rendering
- **Multilingual Support**: Display content in English (default), Spanish, French with fallback handling
- **Category System**: Support Core, Advanced, Integration, Security feature categories with visual badges
- **Priority Ordering**: Display features sorted by priority field with featured items first
- **Publication Control**: Only show features marked as published in Strapi CMS
- **Rich Content**: Support rich text descriptions with proper HTML sanitization
- **Real-time Search**: Filter features by title/description with 200ms response time
- **Interactive Filtering**: Category tabs update display without page reload
- **Content Fallback**: Display English content when translations unavailable

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Features display in responsive grid matching design specifications
- Category filtering works instantly without page refresh
- Search functionality returns results within 200ms
- All features load from Strapi with proper error handling
- Multilingual content displays correctly with fallbacks
- Mobile layout provides optimal touch interaction experience

### Data Requirements
- **Strapi Integration**: Use existing Feature content type from SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md
- **Required Fields**: title, description, category, priority, published status, icon/image
- **i18n Fields**: All text content must support English, Spanish, French locales
- **Data Validation**: Sanitize rich text content to prevent XSS attacks
- **Content Structure**: Features organized by categories with priority-based sorting
- **Media Assets**: Support for feature icons, illustrations, and screenshots

### Security Considerations
- **Content Sanitization**: All rich text content from Strapi must be sanitized to prevent XSS
- **Input Validation**: Search queries validated and sanitized before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Search functionality includes client-side debouncing to prevent API abuse
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Strapi CMS unavailable with fallback content

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load**: Complete feature list loads within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Search Response**: Search results display within 200ms of user input
- **Image Loading**: Lazy loading for feature icons and illustrations
- **Bundle Size**: Feature list component under 15KB compressed
- **Memory Usage**: Component memory footprint under 5MB with 100+ features
