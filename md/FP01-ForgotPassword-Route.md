# Forgot Password Route Setup

## Overview
Create a dedicated `/forgot-password` route in SvelteKit to handle password reset requests for users who have forgotten their login credentials. This route provides a secure entry point for users to initiate the password reset workflow using Better Auth's built-in password reset functionality.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a user who forgot my password, I want to access a dedicated forgot password page so that I can initiate the password reset process
- As a user, I want to be redirected away from the forgot password page if I'm already logged in so that I don't waste time on unnecessary actions
- As a user, I want the forgot password page to be available in my preferred language so that I can understand the instructions clearly
- As a user, I want the forgot password page to maintain consistent branding and navigation so that I feel confident I'm on the legitimate site

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, centered form layout using DaisyUI components matching existing login/signup page design
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper touch targets and viewport optimization
- Consistent visual hierarchy with page title, form area, and navigation links
- Loading states and visual feedback during form interactions
- Accessible design following WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
- Integration with main layout component for consistent header/footer branding

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/forgot-password` directly or via link from login page
2. System checks authentication status using Better Auth client
3. If authenticated, redirect to `/account` route to prevent unnecessary action
4. If not authenticated, display forgot password form with email input field
5. User can navigate back to login page via provided link
6. Form remains ready for password reset request submission (handled in next feature)

### Functional Requirements
- **Route Creation**: Implement `/forgot-password` route using SvelteKit file-based routing at `src/routes/forgot-password/+page.svelte`
- **Authentication Check**: Verify user authentication status on page load using Better Auth client from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md
- **Redirect Logic**: Automatically redirect authenticated users to `/account` route with 302 status code
- **Layout Integration**: Use main layout component from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md for consistent branding
- **Navigation Links**: Include link to `/login` route for users who remember their password
- **Form Preparation**: Create form structure ready for password reset implementation in next feature

### Data Requirements
- No database changes required for this route setup
- Authentication state verification using existing Better Auth session data
- Form preparation for email input validation (implementation in subsequent feature)

### Security Considerations
- Implement CSRF protection preparation for form submission
- Validate redirect destinations to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities
- Ensure no sensitive information is exposed in client-side code
- Apply rate limiting considerations for future form submission implementation

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Authentication check completion within 100ms
- Redirect execution within 200ms for authenticated users
- Form rendering and interaction responsiveness under 500ms
