# LA01-Launch-Checklist.md

## Overview
- Comprehensive production readiness checklist ensuring all systems, security, performance, and user experience requirements are met before launching the SaaS application
- Validates that all critical features are functional, secure, and optimized for production use
- Feature type: Infrastructure Setup

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Pre-launch Validation**: Verify all core features work in production environment including authentication, payments, content management, and internationalization
- **Security Verification**: Confirm all security measures are properly implemented and configured for production use
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure application meets performance requirements under expected production load
- **Content Verification**: Validate all content is properly translated and displays correctly across all supported languages
- **Integration Testing**: Confirm all third-party integrations (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Mautic, OpenAI) work with production credentials
- **Monitoring Setup**: Implement logging, error tracking, and performance monitoring for production environment
- **Backup Strategy**: Establish automated backup procedures for database and critical application data
- **Documentation Completion**: Ensure all user-facing documentation and help content is complete and accurate

### Security Considerations
- **Production Environment Variables**: All sensitive credentials use production values and are properly secured
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: HTTPS enforced across all endpoints with proper certificate management
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS policies, and authentication properly configured for production
- **Database Security**: Production database has restricted access, encrypted connections, and proper user permissions
- **Secret Management**: All API keys and secrets use production-grade secret management solutions
- **Security Headers**: Proper HTTP security headers implemented (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs properly validated and sanitized across the application
- **Authentication Security**: Better Auth configured with secure session management and proper OAuth settings

### Data Requirements
- **Database Migration**: All database schema changes properly applied to production database
- **Seed Data**: Essential configuration data and initial content properly seeded
- **User Migration**: If migrating from existing system, user data transfer procedures validated
- **Content Translation**: All Strapi content properly translated and published in supported languages
- **Pricing Configuration**: Stripe and LemonSqueezy products, prices, and webhooks properly configured

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load Times**: All pages load within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and proper indexing for expected user load
- **CDN Configuration**: Static assets served through CDN for optimal global performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Application-level caching implemented for frequently accessed data
- **Concurrent Users**: Application handles expected concurrent user load without degradation
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and disk usage monitored with alerting thresholds
