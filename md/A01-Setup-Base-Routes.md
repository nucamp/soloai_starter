# A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md

## Overview
Scaffold the core application routes in SvelteKit to establish the fundamental navigation structure for the SaaS application. This creates the routing foundation that will be populated with content from Strapi CMS and integrated with Better Auth, payment systems, and other services in subsequent features.

**Feature Type**: Technical Setup
**Business Value**: Establishes the navigational backbone of the SaaS application, enabling users to access all core functionality through well-organized routes.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Create SvelteKit route structure following file-based routing conventions
- Implement all core public routes (/, /features, /pricing, /contact, /privacy, /terms)
- Implement authentication-required routes (/login, /signup, /account, /forgot-password)
- Each route must have a corresponding `+page.svelte` file with placeholder content
- Routes must be accessible via direct URL navigation and browser back/forward buttons
- All routes must return proper HTTP status codes (200 for existing, 404 for missing)
- Implement basic route hierarchy and organization following SvelteKit best practices

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 11 core routes are accessible via browser navigation
- [ ] Each route displays unique placeholder content identifying the page
- [ ] Routes follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] File structure supports future authentication guards and layout inheritance
- [ ] Route parameters and dynamic routing work correctly
- [ ] 404 handling works for non-existent routes

### Data Requirements
- Routes must be structured to support future dynamic content from Strapi CMS
- File organization must accommodate future internationalization with Paraglide
- Route structure must support nested layouts and authentication guards
- Routes must be prepared for future SEO meta tag integration

### Security Considerations
- Route structure must support future authentication middleware implementation
- Public routes must be clearly separated from protected routes in file organization
- Route naming must not expose sensitive information or internal structure
- Routes must be prepared for future CSRF protection and session management

### Performance Requirements
- Initial page load must complete within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Client-side navigation between routes must complete within 500ms
- Route structure must support code splitting and lazy loading
- Static routes must be pre-renderable for optimal SEO and performance

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- SvelteKit framework (already established in monorepo)
- TypeScript support for type-safe routing
- File-based routing system using SvelteKit conventions

### Route Structure
```
src/routes/
├── +layout.svelte                 # Root layout (future integration point)
├── +page.svelte                   # Homepage (/)
├── features/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Features page (/features)
├── pricing/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Pricing page (/pricing)
├── contact/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Contact page (/contact)
├── privacy/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Privacy Policy (/privacy)
├── terms/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Terms of Service (/terms)
├── login/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Login page (/login)
├── signup/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Signup page (/signup)
├── account/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Account dashboard (/account)
├── forgot-password/
│   └── +page.svelte              # Password reset (/forgot-password)
└── +error.svelte                  # Error page (404, 500, etc.)
```

### Page Component Requirements
Each `+page.svelte` file must include:
- Unique page title in `<svelte:head>` section
- Semantic HTML structure using proper heading hierarchy
- Placeholder content clearly identifying the page purpose
- Basic responsive structure preparation for future styling
- TypeScript support with proper component typing

### Future Integration Points
- **Layout System**: Root layout must support header, navigation, and footer components from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md
- **Authentication**: Login, signup, and account routes must support Better Auth integration from AU01-Install-BetterAuth.md onwards
- **Content Management**: All public pages must support dynamic content loading from Strapi (SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md onwards)
- **Internationalization**: Route structure must support Paraglide i18n implementation from PG01-Paraglide-Install.md onwards
- **Payment Integration**: Pricing and account routes must support Stripe/LemonSqueezy integration from ST01-Stripe-Account-Setup.md onwards

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required for basic route setup.

## Prerequisites
- **DB01-DB-Container-Setup.md**: Database container must be running for future database-dependent features
- **SP01-Strapi-Container-Setup.md**: Strapi CMS must be accessible for future content integration
- **MA01-Mautic-Container-Setup.md**: Mautic must be running for future marketing integration

## Implementation Notes
- Use SvelteKit's file-based routing system for automatic route generation
- Implement consistent TypeScript interfaces for page props and data
- Ensure all routes are accessible and return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Structure files to support future authentication guards and middleware
- Consider SEO implications with proper HTML semantics and meta tag preparation
- Prepare route organization for future internationalization and localization

## Additional Context for AI Assistant
This is the foundational routing setup that establishes the navigation structure for the entire SaaS application. The routes created here will be populated with real content from Strapi CMS, protected with Better Auth authentication, and enhanced with payment integration, internationalization, and other features in subsequent implementation phases.

The route structure should be organized to clearly separate public marketing pages from authenticated user areas, and should follow SvelteKit conventions to enable automatic code splitting, pre-rendering, and other performance optimizations.
