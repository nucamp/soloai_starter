• Establish comprehensive security best practices for managing sensitive credentials and API keys across development, testing, and production environments

• Implement secret isolation with separate credentials for each environment and no cross-environment access

• Apply role-based access control to secrets with audit logging for all secret operations

• Encrypt all secrets at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3)

• Establish automated and manual secret rotation procedures with zero-downtime updates

• Monitor for secret exposure, unauthorized access, and rotation failures

• Use `.env` files with proper file permissions (600) for local development, never commit to version control

• Implement secure secret sharing tools (1Password, Bitwarden, AWS Secrets Manager) for team collaboration

• Use dedicated secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) for production

• Inject secrets at runtime, never store in container images or configuration files

• Build upon EV02-Env-Validation.md to validate secret format and strength requirements

• Provide utilities for generating cryptographically secure secrets with appropriate entropy

• Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines without
