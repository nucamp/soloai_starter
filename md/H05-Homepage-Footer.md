# H05-Homepage-Footer.md

## Overview
Create a comprehensive footer component for the homepage and all pages that includes navigation links, copyright information, social media icons, and legal page access. This footer serves as a secondary navigation area and provides essential business information while maintaining consistent branding across the application.

**Feature type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a website visitor, I want to access all important pages from the footer so I can easily navigate without scrolling to the top
- As a user, I want to see copyright and company information so I understand the business legitimacy
- As a potential customer, I want to find social media links so I can follow the company and see social proof
- As a user on mobile, I want a organized footer layout so I can easily find links on smaller screens

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Multi-column Layout**: Desktop displays 3-4 columns with organized link groups, tablet shows 2 columns, mobile stacks in single column
- **Company Branding**: Logo/brand name prominently displayed with tagline or brief description
- **Navigation Links**: Organized sections for Product (Features, Pricing), Company (About, Contact), and Legal (Privacy, Terms)
- **Social Media Icons**: Horizontal row of social media icons with hover effects and proper sizing (24px minimum)
- **Copyright Notice**: Current year copyright with company name, automatically updated
- **Newsletter Signup**: Optional email subscription form with simple input and submit button
- **Responsive Behavior**: Graceful stacking on mobile with proper spacing and touch targets (44px minimum)

### User Flow
1. User scrolls to bottom of any page
2. See organized footer with multiple sections of links
3. Click on any link to navigate to desired page
4. Social media icons open in new tabs
5. Newsletter signup (if implemented) captures email address

### Functional Requirements
- **Dynamic Copyright Year**: Automatically display current year without manual updates
- **Link Organization**: Group related links into logical sections (Product, Company, Legal, Social)
- **External Link Handling**: Social media links open in new tabs/windows with proper `rel` attributes
- **Responsive Grid**: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive column layout
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper heading hierarchy and link descriptions
- **Internationalization**: Support English, Spanish, and French text using Paraglide i18n system
- **Consistent Styling**: Use DaisyUI footer components with brand colors and typography

### Data Requirements
- **Static Content**: Footer links, copyright text, social media URLs stored in component or configuration
- **Dynamic Elements**: Current year calculation, language-specific text from Paraglide
- **Strapi Integration**: Optional footer content from CMS for easy updates (company description, social links)
- **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal links match existing routes from A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md

### Security Considerations
- **External Links**: Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to all external social media links
- **Link Validation**: Validate all URLs to prevent malicious redirects
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize any dynamic content if pulling from Strapi CMS

### Performance Requirements
- **Render Time**: Footer must render within 500ms after main content loads
- **Image Optimization**: Social media icons optimized for web (SVG preferred, under 5KB each)
- **Mobile Performance**: Touch targets minimum 44px height for accessibility
- **Lazy Loading**: Social media icons can be lazy loaded if below the fold

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Existing Layout System**: Integrate with main layout component from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md
- **Styling Framework**: Use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI footer components from A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md
- **Internationalization**: Paraglide i18n system from PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md for multilingual text
- **Routing**: SvelteKit routing for internal navigation links
- **Optional CMS**: Strapi CMS integration for dynamic footer content management

### Database Changes
- **No Direct Changes**: Footer uses existing content or static configuration
- **Optional Extension**: If using Strapi, extend existing content types or create Footer content type

### API Changes
- **No New Endpoints**: Uses existing routing and optional Strapi content endpoints
- **Optional CMS API**: If using Strapi, leverage existing `/api/footer` or site settings endpoint

### Environment Variables
- **Social Media URLs**: Consider `PUBLIC_SOCIAL_*` variables for easy configuration
- **Company Information**: `PUBLIC_COMPANY_NAME`, `PUBLIC_COMPANY_TAGLINE` for branding

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

This footer component should:

1. **Integrate with Existing Layout**: Build upon the main layout system established in A02-Create-Layout-Component.md, potentially as a separate Footer component imported into the main layout

2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use the same internationalization patterns from completed Paraglide setup (PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md) and styling conventions from Tailwind/DaisyUI configuration (A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md)

3. **Reference Completed Routes**: Link to all routes established in A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md including public pages (/, /features, /pricing, /contact, /privacy, /terms) and authentication pages (/login, /signup)

4. **Prepare for Future Features**: Structure the footer to accommodate upcoming billing/account links when user authentication is fully implemented, and potential integration with Mautic newsletter signup workflows

5. **Mobile-First Design**: Follow the established responsive design patterns using Tailwind's mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

6. **Accessibility Standards**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance established in previous components with proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation

The footer should serve as a foundational component that will remain stable throughout the application development while providing essential navigation and branding elements.
