## Additional Context for AI Assistant

This feature builds upon the established Strapi CMS integration and prepares for future payment system integration. The pricing tiers will be referenced by upcoming Stripe (ST06-Configure-Stripe-Products.md) and LemonSqueezy (LS05-Configure-LemonSqueezy-Products.md) integration features.

Key integration points:
- **Content Management**: Uses existing Strapi setup and permissions system
- **Styling System**: Follows established DaisyUI component patterns
- **Internationalization**: Integrates with existing Paraglide i18n workflow
- **Future Payment Integration**: Pricing data structure should accommodate Stripe/LemonSqueezy product IDs

The implementation should create a scalable foundation that marketing teams can manage independently while supporting future automated payment processing workflows.
