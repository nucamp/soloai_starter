# Pricing Route & Page Setup

## Overview

**Feature type**: User-Facing Feature

**Business value**: Provides clear pricing communication to drive subscription conversions and support sales funnel completion.

## Requirements

### User Stories

- As a mobile user, I want responsive pricing cards so that I can compare plans on any device
- As a decision maker, I want to see feature comparisons so that I can understand value differences between tiers

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, card-based pricing layout using DaisyUI components
