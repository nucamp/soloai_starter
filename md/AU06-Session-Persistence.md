# AU06-Session-Persistence.md

## Overview
- Implement automatic session persistence and synchronization for Better Auth client to maintain authentication state across page reloads, browser tabs, and network interruptions
- Ensures seamless user experience with persistent login sessions and real-time session updates
- Feature type: Technical Integration

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Automatic Session Initialization**: Session state must be automatically fetched and initialized when the application starts
- **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Authentication state must sync across multiple browser tabs and windows in real-time
- **Session Refresh**: Automatically refresh expired sessions without user interaction when possible
- **Network Recovery**: Handle network interruptions gracefully and restore session state when connectivity returns
- **State Reactivity**: Session changes must trigger reactive updates throughout the application immediately
- **Logout Propagation**: Logout actions must propagate across all open tabs and trigger appropriate redirects

### Integration Requirements
- **Better Auth Client**: Build upon AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md configuration with createAuthClient instance
- **Route Protection**: Work seamlessly with AU05-Protect-Routes.md middleware to prevent authentication flashing
- **Layout Integration**: Integrate with A02-Create-Layout-Component.md for consistent authentication state display
- **Session Guards**: Support protected route access checks from existing route guard implementation

### User Experience Requirements
- **No Authentication Flash**: Prevent unauthenticated content from briefly appearing to logged-in users
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators during session initialization and refresh
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of session errors with fallback to login prompt
- **Instant Updates**: Authentication state changes must reflect immediately in UI components
- **Persistent Sessions**: Maintain login state across browser restarts and application updates

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Better Auth client from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md
- SvelteKit's browser utilities and stores
- Existing authentication context and layout components

### Session Management Architecture
- **Client-Side Storage**: Utilize Better Auth's built-in session management with secure cookie handling
- **Reactive Stores**: Create Svelte stores for session state that update automatically
- **Event Listeners**: Listen for Better Auth session events and storage changes
- **Tab Communication**: Use BroadcastChannel API or storage events for cross-tab synchronization

### Performance Requirements
- Session initialization must complete within 100ms on application start
- Session refresh operations must not block user interactions
- Memory usage for session management must not exceed 1MB
- Cross-tab synchronization must propagate within 50ms

### Security Considerations
- **Token Security**: Never expose JWT tokens in client-side JavaScript or local storage
- **Session Validation**: Regularly validate session authenticity with server
- **Automatic Logout**: Clear all session data on security-related events
- **CSRF Protection**: Maintain CSRF token validity during session operations

### Environment Variables
- Utilize existing BETTER_AUTH_SECRET and BETTER_AUTH_URL from AU02-BetterAuth-Init.md
- No additional environment variables required

## Integration Points

### Prerequisites
- AU01-Install-BetterAuth.md: Better Auth packages and environment setup
- AU02-BetterAuth-Init.md: Better Auth server configuration
- AU03-Mount-BetterAuth-Handler.md: Server handler at `/api/auth/[...all]`
- AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md: Better Auth client instance and global context
- AU05-Protect-Routes.md: Route protection middleware

### Database Changes
- No additional database changes required
- Utilizes existing Better Auth session tables from AU02-BetterAuth-Init.md

### API Changes  
- No new API endpoints required
- Leverages existing Better Auth handler endpoints

## Implementation Requirements

### Session Store Management
- Create reactive Svelte stores for user session, authentication status, and loading states
- Implement automatic subscription to Better Auth session changes
- Handle session state persistence across page navigation and reloads
- Provide typed interfaces for session data access throughout the application

### Cross-Tab Communication
- Implement BroadcastChannel or storage event listeners for tab synchronization
- Ensure logout in one tab immediately logs out all other tabs
- Propagate session updates (profile changes, role updates) across tabs
- Handle edge cases like rapid tab opening/closing scenarios

### Error Handling and Recovery
- Implement exponential backoff for session refresh failures
- Provide fallback authentication prompts when session cannot be restored
- Handle network connectivity issues with appropriate user feedback
- Gracefully degrade functionality when session services are unavailable

### Performance Optimization
- Implement session data caching to minimize API calls
- Use efficient event handling to prevent memory leaks
- Optimize session refresh timing to balance security and performance
- Minimize DOM updates during session state changes

## Integration with Existing Components

### Layout Component Updates
- Update A02-Create-Layout-Component.md to use persistent session data
- Ensure authentication status displays consistently across all pages
- Handle loading states during session initialization in header/navigation

### Route Guard Enhancement
- Enhance AU05-Protect-Routes.md middleware to use persistent session state
- Eliminate authentication delays and redirect flashing
- Improve user experience on protected route access

### Future Integration Points
- Prepare for D02-Account-Overview.md integration with user profile data
- Support MA02-Mautic-API-Auth.md user provisioning workflows
- Enable ST05-Stripe-Portal-Integration.md subscription data display

## Security and Compliance
- Follow Better Auth security best practices for session management
- Implement secure session timeout handling
- Ensure GDPR compliance for session data storage
- Maintain audit trails for session security events

## Performance Targets
- Application startup with session check: < 100ms
- Session refresh operations: < 200ms
- Cross-tab synchronization: < 50ms
- Memory footprint: < 1MB for session management

## Error Scenarios
- Network connectivity loss during session operations
- Concurrent session modifications across multiple tabs
- Server-side session invalidation events
- Browser security policy changes affecting session storage
