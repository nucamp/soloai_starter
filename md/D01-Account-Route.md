# Account Dashboard Route

## Overview
Create a secure `/account` route that serves as the main dashboard for authenticated users, providing access to profile information, account settings, and subscription management. This route establishes the foundation for user self-service functionality and integrates with all authentication, content management, and future billing systems.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature  
**Business Value**: Enables user retention through self-service account management and provides centralized access to all user-specific functionality.

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As an authenticated user, I want to access my account dashboard so that I can manage my profile and view account information
- As a user, I want to see my current subscription status so that I can understand my plan benefits and limitations
- As a user, I want to be redirected to login if I'm not authenticated so that my account data remains secure
- As a user, I want the dashboard to load quickly so that I can efficiently manage my account

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, organized dashboard layout using DaisyUI components with card-based sections
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper spacing and touch targets (minimum 44px height)
- Dashboard sections for profile overview, account status, subscription details, and quick actions
- Navigation breadcrumbs showing "Account" or localized equivalent
- Loading states during data fetching with skeleton components
- Empty states with helpful messaging when data is unavailable
- Consistent visual hierarchy using proper heading structure (h1 for page title, h2 for sections)

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/account` directly or via navigation menu
2. System checks authentication status using Better Auth session
3. If unauthenticated: redirect to `/login?redirect=/account`
4. If authenticated: load user data and render dashboard
5. Display profile information, account status, and available actions
6. Provide navigation to account management functions

### Functional Requirements
- **Authentication Guard**: Route must be protected using Better Auth session validation
- **Session Check**: Verify valid session exists before rendering dashboard content
- **Redirect Handling**: Unauthenticated users redirected to `/login?redirect=/account`
- **User Data Display**: Show authenticated user's profile information from Better Auth session
- **Account Status**: Display account creation date, last login, and verification status
- **Navigation Integration**: Accessible via main navigation and direct URL access
- **Loading Performance**: Page must load within 2 seconds with authentication check under 100ms
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of session expiration and network errors

### Data Requirements
- **User Session Data**: Access Better Auth session including user ID, email, name, and timestamps
- **Profile Information**: Display user's email address, display name, account creation date
- **Account Status**: Show email verification status, last login timestamp, account standing
- **Future Integration Points**: Prepare data structure for subscription info from Stripe/LemonSqueezy
- **Localization**: All text content must support English, Spanish, and French via Paraglide

### Security Considerations
- **Route Protection**: Implement server-side and client-side authentication guards
- **Session Validation**: Verify session authenticity with Better Auth server methods
- **CSRF Protection**: Ensure all future forms implement CSRF token validation
- **Data Privacy**: Only display user's own data, never expose other users' information
- **Secure Headers**: Implement proper HTTP security headers for dashboard pages

### Performance Requirements
- **Initial Load**: Complete page render within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Authentication Check**: Session validation must complete within 100ms
- **Interactive Elements**: Button clicks and navigation must respond within 200ms
- **Mobile Performance**: Maintain performance standards across all device types
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching for user data to reduce server requests

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Authentication**: Better Auth client from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md
- **Route Protection**: Better Auth server methods for session validation
- **Layout**: Main layout component from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI from A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md
- **Internationalization**: Paraglide i18n from PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

### Database Changes
- No new database changes required
- Utilizes existing Better Auth user tables and session management
- Prepares for future subscription data integration

### API Changes
- No new API endpoints required for initial implementation
- Utilizes existing Better Auth session validation endpoints
- Prepares integration points for future billing API connections

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Uses existing BETTER_AUTH_SECRET and authentication configuration
- Prepares for future STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY integration

## Implementation Requirements

### File Structure
- Create `src/routes/account/+page.svelte` for main dashboard component
- Create `src/routes/account/+layout.server.ts` for server-side authentication guard
- Create `src/routes/account/+layout.ts` for client-side session handling
- Organize account-related components in `src/lib/components/account/` directory

### Component Architecture
- **Dashboard Layout**: Main container with responsive grid layout
- **Profile Card**: User information display with edit button (future feature)
- **Account Status**: Account standing and verification status
- **Quick Actions**: Navigation to account management functions
- **Subscription Overview**: Placeholder section for future billing integration

### Authentication Integration
- Implement server-side session validation in `+layout.server.ts`
- Use Better Auth `getSession()` method for session retrieval
- Handle authentication failures with proper error responses
- Maintain session reactivity for real-time updates

### Internationalization Support
- Create translation keys for all dashboard text content
- Support dynamic content based on user's selected locale
- Maintain consistent terminology across all account-related pages
- Prepare for future localized billing and subscription content

### Responsive Design Requirements
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible sections on smaller screens
- Tablet layout with two-column card arrangement
- Desktop layout with multi-column dashboard sections
- Maintain accessibility standards across all breakpoints

### Error Handling and Loading States
- Show loading skeletons during data fetching
- Handle session expiration with graceful redirects
- Display appropriate error messages for network failures
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed data requests

### Future Integration Preparation
- Design component structure to accommodate subscription data
- Prepare data models for billing information display
- Create extension points for account management forms
- Structure navigation for additional account-related pages

## Acceptance Criteria
