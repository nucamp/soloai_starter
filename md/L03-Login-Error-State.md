# Login Error State Management

## Overview
Implement comprehensive error and success feedback for the login form to provide clear user communication during authentication processes. This builds upon the login form from L02-Login-Form.md to enhance user experience with proper error handling, loading states, and success confirmation.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a user attempting to login, I want to see clear error messages when authentication fails so I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it
- As a user with invalid credentials, I want to see specific feedback about whether my email or password is incorrect
- As a user experiencing network issues, I want to see appropriate error messages and retry options
- As a user successfully logging in, I want visual confirmation before being redirected
- As a user, I want to see loading states during authentication so I know the system is processing my request

### UI/UX Requirements
- Error messages must appear inline below relevant form fields with red styling using DaisyUI error classes
- Success states should show green confirmation messages with checkmark icons
- Loading states must disable form submission and show spinner/loading indicator
- Error messages should auto-dismiss after successful retry or manual dismissal
- All feedback messages must be accessible with proper ARIA labels and role attributes
- Mobile-first responsive design maintaining readability across all screen sizes

### User Flow
1. User fills out login form from L02-Login-Form.md
2. User submits form → loading state appears → form disables
3. Authentication request processes through Better Auth client
4. **Success Path**: Show success message → redirect after 1-2 seconds
5. **Error Path**: Display specific error message → re-enable form → allow retry

### Functional Requirements
- Display authentication errors from Better Auth client with user-friendly messages
- Handle network connectivity issues with appropriate messaging and retry options
- Show loading states during all authentication requests (email/password and OAuth)
- Provide success confirmation before redirect to intended destination
- Support dismissible error messages with close button or auto-dismiss functionality
- Maintain form state during error recovery (preserve entered email address)
- Implement proper error categorization: invalid credentials, account issues, network errors, server errors

### Data Requirements
- Error state management using reactive Svelte stores or component state
- Error message mapping from Better Auth error codes to user-friendly text
- Loading state tracking for form submission and OAuth provider authentication
- Success state with redirect URL preservation from query parameters

### Security Considerations
- Never expose sensitive authentication details in error messages
- Avoid revealing whether specific email addresses exist in the system
- Implement rate limiting awareness with appropriate user feedback
- Sanitize all error messages to prevent XSS attacks
- Log authentication errors securely without exposing user credentials

### Performance Requirements
- Error messages must appear within 100ms of authentication failure
- Loading states should activate immediately upon form submission
- Success confirmation should display within 200ms of successful authentication
- Error message rendering must not cause layout shifts or performance degradation

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Better Auth client from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md for authentication state management
- Paraglide i18n from PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md for error message localization
- DaisyUI components for consistent error/success styling
- Existing login form component from L02-Login-Form.md

### Integration Points
- Extends login form component created in L02-Login-Form.md with error handling
- Integrates with Better Auth client error responses and authentication states
- Uses main layout component from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md for consistent styling
- Connects to internationalization system for multi-language error messages

### Environment Variables
- Uses existing Better Auth configuration from AU02-BetterAuth-Init.md
- No additional environment variables required

### Error Handling Implementation
- Map Better Auth error codes to user-friendly messages
- Implement error state reactive variables in Svelte component
- Create error message components with proper ARIA attributes
- Handle async/await error catching for authentication requests
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for network errors

### Internationalization Requirements
- All error messages must have translation keys in Paraglide message catalogs
- Support English, Spanish, and French error messages
- Error message translations should maintain consistent tone and clarity
- Include context-specific error messages for different authentication providers

### Accessibility Requirements
- Error messages must have `role="alert"` for screen reader announcement
- Loading states must have proper `aria-busy` and `aria-describedby` attributes
- Error dismissal buttons must be keyboard accessible
- Success messages must be announced to screen readers
- Form fields with errors must have `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby` pointing to error message

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

This feature completes the login user experience by adding proper feedback mechanisms. The implementation should:

1. **Build on Existing Login Form**: Enhance the form component from L02-Login-Form.md rather than creating a separate component
2. **Use Better Auth Error Handling**: Leverage Better Auth client's error responses and states
3. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use the same styling, layout, and i18n patterns from previous components
4. **Prepare for Account Route**: Success states should redirect to `/account` route that will be created in D01-Account-Route.md
5. **Support Social OAuth Errors**: Handle errors from Google, GitHub, and Discord authentication flows
6. **Maintain Security**: Follow security patterns established in environment and secret management guides

The error handling should be comprehensive but not overwhelming to users, providing clear next steps for resolution while maintaining the professional appearance established in the layout and styling components.
