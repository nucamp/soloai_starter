# Custom Error Pages Implementation

## Overview
- Create custom 404 and error pages with consistent branding and navigation to improve user experience when encountering missing pages or application errors
- Provide helpful error messaging and recovery options for users who encounter broken links or server issues
- Maintain design consistency with the rest of the application using established layout components and styling
- Feature type: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a helpful error page when I visit a non-existent URL so that I understand what happened and can navigate back to working parts of the site
- As a user, I want to see branded error messaging that matches the site design so that I maintain trust in the application
- As a user, I want clear navigation options from error pages so that I can easily return to useful content
- As a content manager, I want error pages that are translatable through Paraglide so that international users receive localized error messages

### UI/UX Requirements
- Custom 404 page with clear "Page Not Found" messaging and helpful navigation links
- Generic error page for 500/server errors with appropriate messaging and recovery guidance
- Error pages must use the main layout component from `A02-Create-Layout-Component.md` for consistent header/footer
- Responsive design following mobile-first approach established in `A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md`
- Visual hierarchy with prominent error messaging, explanatory text, and clear call-to-action buttons
- Error illustrations or icons that match the overall design aesthetic
- Navigation breadcrumbs or site map links to help users orient themselves

### User Flow
1. User encounters missing page or server error
2. Application displays appropriate custom error page with consistent branding
3. User sees clear error explanation and available options
4. User can click navigation links to return to homepage, features, or other core sections
5. Error page maintains language preference from Paraglide i18n system

### Functional Requirements
- **404 Error Handling**: Custom page for missing routes that returns proper HTTP 404 status code
- **Generic Error Handling**: Catch-all error page for server errors (500, 503, etc.) with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Navigation Integration**: Include links to all core pages established in `A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md` (/, /features, /pricing, /contact)
- **Layout Consistency**: Use main layout component from `A02-Create-Layout-Component.md` with header, navigation, footer
- **Internationalization**: Error messages and navigation text must be translatable using Paraglide system from `PG01-Paraglide-Install.md`
- **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags, page titles, and structured data for error pages
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper heading structure, alt text, and keyboard navigation

### Data Requirements
- Translation keys in Paraglide message catalogs for error page content (error.notFound.title, error.notFound.message, etc.)
- No database storage required - error pages are static/templated content
- Error logging capability for tracking 404s and server errors (optional for analytics)

### Security Considerations
- Error pages must not expose sensitive information about server configuration or file structure
- Generic error messaging that doesn't reveal internal application details
- Proper input sanitization if displaying user-provided URLs in error messages
- Rate limiting consideration for error page requests to prevent abuse

### Performance Requirements
- Error pages must load within 2 seconds even during high server load
- Minimal resource usage - error pages should be lightweight and not add to server stress
- Error pages should work even if other parts of the application are experiencing issues
- Client-side error boundary implementation to catch and display JavaScript errors gracefully

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Existing SvelteKit routing system from `A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md`
- Main layout component from `A02-Create-Layout-Component.md`
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI styling from `A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md`
- Paraglide i18n system from `PG01-Paraglide-Install.md` and `PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md`
- Translation message catalogs supporting English, Spanish, and French locales

### Database Changes
- No database changes required
- Optional: Error logging table for analytics (not required for core functionality)

### API Changes
- No new API endpoints required
- Error pages should handle API failures gracefully by displaying fallback content

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Error pages should function even if other environment variables are missing or invalid

```

│   └── +layout.svelte         # Main layout (already exists)

    └── fr.json                # French error translations
```

## Integration Points

### With Completed Features
- **Layout System**: Use main layout component from `A02-Create-Layout-Component.md` for consistent header, navigation, and footer
- **Styling**: Apply Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI classes and design tokens from `A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md`
- **Routing**: Integrate with SvelteKit routing system established in `A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md`
- **Internationalization**: Use Paraglide translation functions and message catalogs from `PG01-Paraglide-Install.md` and `PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md`
- **Navigation**: Include links to all core routes defined in base routes setup

### With Future Features
- **Authentication**: Error pages will need to handle authentication state once Better Auth is implemented
- **SEO Meta**: Error pages will integrate with meta tag system from upcoming `A04-SEO-Meta-Config.md`
- **Analytics**: Optional integration with error tracking for monitoring 404s and user experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error pages maintain user's selected language preference
- [ ] Error pages include helpful recovery options and clear call-to-action buttons

## Notes for AI Developer
- SvelteKit uses `+error.svelte` files for error handling - create this in the routes directory
- Error pages should gracefully degrade if other systems (Strapi, translations) are unavailable
- Consider implementing client-side error boundaries for JavaScript errors using Svelte's error handling
- Error pages are often the first impression when users encounter broken links - prioritize helpful, branded user experience
- Test error pages by navigating to non-existent routes and simulating server errors
