# TS02-Playwright-Setup.md

## Overview
Set up Playwright v1.40+ as the end-to-end testing framework for the SvelteKit SaaS application to test complete user workflows including authentication, content management, payment processing, and multilingual functionality. This establishes comprehensive browser automation testing to ensure all integrated systems work together correctly.

**Feature type**: Technical Integration

**Business value**: Ensures production-ready application quality through automated testing of critical user journeys and prevents regressions in complex workflows involving multiple services (Strapi, Mautic, Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Better Auth).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Test Environment Setup**: Configure isolated test environment with separate database, API keys, and service instances
- **Browser Coverage**: Support Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers with headless and headed modes
- **Authentication Testing**: Test complete Better Auth flows including signup, login, logout, and session persistence
- **Content Management Testing**: Verify Strapi CMS content rendering, multilingual display, and dynamic updates
- **Payment Flow Testing**: Test Stripe and LemonSqueezy checkout processes with mock payment methods
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure consistent behavior across different browsers and viewport sizes
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently with clean state and no cross-test contamination
- **Visual Testing**: Support screenshot comparison and visual regression detection
- **API Mocking**: Mock external services for reliable test execution without external dependencies

### Performance Requirements
- Test suite execution must complete within 10 minutes for full browser matrix
- Individual test files must complete within 2 minutes
- Browser launch time under 5 seconds per instance
- Page navigation and interaction response within 3 seconds
- Screenshot capture and comparison within 1 second
- Parallel test execution support for up to 4 concurrent browser instances

### Security Considerations
- Use test-specific API keys and credentials separate from development/production
- Mock sensitive operations like actual payment processing
- Sanitize test data to prevent exposure of sensitive information
- Implement secure test user account management with automated cleanup
- Validate that test environment cannot access production services or data
- Protect test credentials using environment variables and secure storage

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies

- Better Auth to Mautic user provisioning
- Payment processor to subscription status updates
- AI translation workflow end-to-end
- Cross-service error handling

## Development and Maintenance

### Test Organization
- **Structure**: Tests organized by feature area matching application routing
- **Naming**: Descriptive test names following `feature.action.expected-result` pattern
- **Documentation**: Each test file includes purpose, prerequisites, and maintenance notes
- **Tagging**: Test categorization for selective execution (smoke, regression, integration)

### Continuous Integration
- **Integration**: Works with existing GitHub Actions workflow from CI01-GitHub-Actions-Init.md
- **Parallel Execution**: Supports parallel test execution for faster CI/CD pipelines
- **Artifact Collection**: Screenshots and videos on test failures for debugging
- **Result Reporting**: JUnit XML and HTML reports for CI/CD integration

### Prerequisites
- Completed TS01-Vitest-Setup.md for unit testing foundation
- Existing Better Auth setup from AU01-Install-BetterAuth.md through AU06-Session-Persistence.md
