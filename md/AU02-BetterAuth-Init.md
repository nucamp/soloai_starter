# Better Auth Initialization & Configuration

## Overview
- Initialize Better Auth server configuration with database adapter, email/password authentication, and social OAuth providers
- Establish authentication foundation for user registration, login, and session management
- Configure secure JWT handling, email verification, and multi-provider authentication options
- Feature type: Technical Integration

## Requirements

### Service Details
- Better Auth v1.0+ server package for authentication logic
- **Prisma ORM** as database adapter connecting to `soloai_db` (from DB02-Prisma-Setup.md)
- MySQL database container from DB01-DB-Container-Setup.md
- Email provider integration for verification and password reset flows
- Social OAuth providers: Google, GitHub, Discord for streamlined registration

### Authentication Methods
- Email/password authentication with secure password hashing (Argon2)
- Social login support with OAuth 2.0 flow handling
- Email verification workflow for new user accounts
- Password reset functionality with secure token generation

### Security Configuration
- JWT secret management using BETTER_AUTH_SECRET environment variable
- Session handling with secure cookie configuration and CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts and password reset requests
- Input validation and sanitization for all authentication fields

### Database Integration
- Connect to `soloai_db` database via Prisma Client (from DB02-Prisma-Setup.md)
- Better Auth auto-generates authentication tables via Prisma schema:
  - `user`: User accounts with id, email, name, emailVerified, image, timestamps
  - `session`: Active user sessions with expiration handling
  - `account`: OAuth provider connections (Google, GitHub, Discord)
  - `verification`: Email verification and password reset tokens
- Prisma migrations track all schema changes
- Type-safe database access via Prisma Client for all auth operations

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- better-auth (server package) - installed in AU01-Install-BetterAuth.md
- **Prisma ORM** (@prisma/client and prisma) - configured in DB02-Prisma-Setup.md
- **Prisma adapter** from `better-auth/adapters/prisma` - connects Better Auth to Prisma ORM
- **Better Auth CLI** (@better-auth/cli) - for schema generation and migrations
- Email provider SDK (nodemailer, resend, or similar)
- OAuth provider SDKs for social authentication
- Crypto utilities for secure token generation

### Database Changes
- Authentication tables auto-generated by Better Auth
- User table with id, email, name, emailVerified, image, createdAt, updatedAt
- Session table for active user sessions with expiration handling
- Account table for OAuth provider connections
- Verification token table for email verification and password reset

### Environment Variables
- BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (32+ character cryptographically secure string)
- BETTER_AUTH_URL (base URL for authentication callbacks)
- EMAIL_FROM, EMAIL_SERVER_HOST, EMAIL_SERVER_PORT, EMAIL_SERVER_USER, EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (OAuth credentials)
- GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET (OAuth credentials)
- DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET (OAuth credentials)

### Configuration Requirements
- Create `src/lib/auth.ts` or `src/auth.ts` file with Better Auth initialization
- Configure Prisma adapter using `prismaAdapter(prisma, { provider: "mysql" })` syntax
- Import PrismaClient instance from DB02-Prisma-Setup.md configuration
- **Important**: Specify correct database provider in adapter config (e.g., "mysql", "postgresql", "sqlite")
- **Schema Generation**: Run `npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate` to create auth tables in Prisma schema
- **Migration**: After schema generation, run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply database changes
- Set up email provider configuration for verification and password reset emails
- Configure OAuth providers with proper redirect URLs and scopes
- Implement session management with appropriate expiration and refresh handling
- Enable email verification requirement for new user accounts
- Configure password requirements (minimum length, complexity)
- Set up proper error handling and logging for authentication events

### Basic Configuration Example
```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
    provider: "mysql", // Must match your database type
  }),
  // Additional configuration for email, OAuth providers, etc.
});
```

**Note**: If using a custom Prisma output directory in your `schema.prisma` file, import PrismaClient from that custom location instead of `@prisma/client`.

### Integration Points
- Database connection via Prisma to `soloai_db` in MySQL container (DB02-Prisma-Setup.md)
- Better Auth auto-generates Prisma models for auth tables via CLI
- Email configuration must support future Mautic integration workflow
- User data structure must accommodate future profile management features
- Authentication configuration must support future route protection implementation
- Session handling must integrate with SvelteKit's server-side rendering
- Type-safe database queries via Prisma Client for all auth operations

### Security Considerations
- JWT secrets must be cryptographically secure and environment-specific
- Session cookies must be httpOnly, secure, and sameSite protected
- OAuth redirect URLs must be validated and restricted to application domains
- Password hashing must use Argon2 or equivalent secure algorithm
- Rate limiting must prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
- Email verification tokens must have appropriate expiration and single-use enforcement

## Prerequisites
- DB01-DB-Container-Setup.md (MySQL database container)
- **DB02-Prisma-Setup.md (Prisma ORM and soloai_db database configuration)**
- AU01-Install-BetterAuth.md (Better Auth packages and environment variables)
- EV01-Env-File-Setup.md (environment variable management)
- EV02-Env-Validation.md (environment variable validation)

## Success Criteria
- Better Auth server successfully initializes with all configured providers
- Database tables are automatically created and accessible
- Email verification workflow functions correctly
- Social OAuth providers successfully authenticate test users
- JWT tokens are properly signed and validated
- Authentication configuration supports all planned authentication flows
- No authentication secrets are exposed in client-side code or logs
