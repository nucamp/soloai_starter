# Password Reset Success Confirmation

## Overview
- Create success confirmation UI that displays after a user successfully submits a password reset request
- Provides clear next steps and builds user confidence in the password recovery process
- Feature type: User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a user who forgot my password, I want to see confirmation that my reset request was sent so I know the process is working
- As a user, I want clear instructions about what to do next so I can complete the password recovery
- As a user, I want to be able to return to login if I remember my password
- As a user, I want to request another reset email if I don't receive the first one

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, centered confirmation message using DaisyUI components matching existing form styling
- Success icon or checkmark to provide positive visual feedback
- Clear heading confirming the action was successful
- Instructional text explaining next steps (check email, click link, etc.)
- Secondary actions: "Return to Login" and "Resend Reset Email" links
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper touch targets (minimum 44px height)
- Consistent branding and visual hierarchy matching login/signup pages

### User Flow
1. User submits password reset form from FP02-ForgotPass-Form.md
2. Form successfully processes and redirects to success state
3. User sees confirmation message with clear next steps
4. User can return to login or request another reset email
5. User receives reset email and follows link to complete password recovery

### Functional Requirements
- Display success confirmation after successful password reset request submission
- Show user's email address (masked for privacy: j***@example.com) to confirm destination
- Provide "Return to Login" button linking to `/login` route
- Include "Resend Reset Email" functionality with rate limiting (1 request per 60 seconds)
- Support email enumeration protection by not revealing if email exists in system
- Handle resend requests with loading states and success/error feedback
- Auto-dismiss any form errors when transitioning to success state

### Data Requirements
- Access to submitted email address for display confirmation (masked)
- Track resend attempts per email/IP address for rate limiting
- Store timestamp of last reset request for rate limiting enforcement
- No persistent storage of success state (stateless confirmation)

### Security Considerations
- Mask displayed email addresses to prevent shoulder surfing (show first character and domain)
- Implement rate limiting for resend requests (1 per minute per email/IP)
- Validate email format before allowing resend attempts
- Use CSRF protection for resend form submissions
- Prevent email enumeration by showing same success message regardless of email existence
- Log suspicious activity (excessive resend attempts from same IP)

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time under 1 second after redirect from form submission
- Resend request processing within 3 seconds
- Visual feedback for resend action within 200ms
- Rate limiting check within 100ms

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Better Auth client for password reset functionality (from AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md)
- Paraglide i18n for multilingual support (from PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md)
- DaisyUI components for consistent styling (from A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md)
- Main layout component integration (from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md)
- Better Auth session management for authentication checks

### Database Changes
- No new database tables required
- Utilize existing Better Auth password reset tracking tables
- May need to track rate limiting data (consider in-memory store or existing session tables)

### API Changes
- Extend Better Auth password reset endpoints for resend functionality
- Add rate limiting middleware for resend requests
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### Environment Variables
- Use existing Better Auth configuration variables
- No new environment variables required
- Leverage existing email provider settings for resend functionality

## Integration Points

### Prerequisites (must be completed)
- FP01-ForgotPass-Route.md: Forgot password route structure
- FP02-ForgotPass-Form.md: Password reset form submission handling
- AU04-Global-Client-Setup.md: Better Auth client configuration
- PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md: Internationalization setup
- A02-Create-Layout-Component.md: Main layout component
- A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md: Styling framework

### Implementation Context
- Integrate with form submission success callback from FP02-ForgotPass-Form.md
- Use established design patterns from login/signup success states
- Follow accessibility standards established in L02-Login-Form.md and S02-Signup-Form.md
- Maintain consistency with error handling patterns from L03-Login-Error-State.md

### Future Integration Points
- Will connect to actual email reset workflow when implemented
- May integrate with account dashboard for password change history
- Could connect to user analytics for tracking password reset completion rates

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper heading hierarchy (h1 for main confirmation)
- Screen reader support with descriptive text and ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- High contrast colors meeting accessibility standards
- Focus management ensuring logical tab order

## Internationalization
- Support English (default), Spanish (es), and French (fr) locales
- Translation keys for confirmation message, instructions, and button text
- Culturally appropriate messaging for different markets
- Preserve email masking format across all languages

## Security Considerations
- Email masking format: show first character, asterisks for middle, full domain
- Rate limiting: maximum 1 resend request per 60 seconds per email address
- IP-based rate limiting: maximum 5 resend requests per hour per IP
- CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Input sanitization for email addresses
- Audit logging for security monitoring
