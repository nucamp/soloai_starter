# FP02-ForgotPass-Form.md

## Overview
Build a comprehensive password reset request form component that integrates with Better Auth's password reset functionality to enable secure password recovery for users who have forgotten their credentials. This form provides the core functionality for the forgot password flow, handling email submission, validation, and user feedback while maintaining security best practices.

**Feature Type**: User-Facing Feature
**Business Value**: Reduces support burden and improves user retention by providing self-service password recovery

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a user who forgot my password, I want to enter my email address so that I can receive a password reset link
- As a user, I want immediate feedback when I submit the form so that I know my request is being processed
- As a user, I want clear error messages if something goes wrong so that I can understand what to do next
- As a user, I want the form to be accessible and work on my mobile device so that I can reset my password anywhere

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, centered form layout using DaisyUI components matching existing login/signup design patterns
- Single email input field with proper validation styling and feedback
- Primary submit button with loading state and disabled state during processing
- Inline error messages that appear below the email field with red DaisyUI error styling
- Loading spinner or indicator during form submission to show processing state
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper touch targets (minimum 44px height)
- Visual hierarchy with clear form title and instructions
- Consistent branding and styling matching other authentication pages

### User Flow
1. User navigates to `/forgot-password` route (from FP01-ForgotPass-Route.md)
2. User sees form with email input field and clear instructions
3. User enters their email address with real-time validation feedback
4. User clicks "Send Reset Link" button
5. Form shows loading state and disables submission
6. Form displays success message or error feedback based on response
7. On success, user is informed to check their email for reset instructions

### Functional Requirements
- **Email Validation**: Must validate email format using RFC 5322 compliant regex before submission
- **Better Auth Integration**: Use Better Auth client methods for password reset request functionality
- **Form Submission**: Handle form submission with proper error handling and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Show visual loading indicators during API requests with form disabled
- **Error Handling**: Display specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Success Feedback**: Provide clear confirmation when reset email is sent successfully
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper labels, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle rate limiting errors gracefully with appropriate user messaging

### Data Requirements
- **Email Field**: Text input with email validation, required field validation
- **Form State**: Track submission status, loading state, error state, and success state
- **Validation State**: Real-time email format validation with visual feedback
- **Error Messages**: Specific error text for different failure scenarios

### Security Considerations
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize email input to prevent XSS attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF token validation for form submissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect and handle Better Auth rate limiting for password reset requests
- **Email Enumeration Protection**: Don't reveal whether email exists in system through error messages
- **Secure Transmission**: Ensure all form data is transmitted over HTTPS in production

### Performance Requirements
- **Form Validation**: Email validation must complete within 100ms
- **API Response**: Password reset request must complete within 3 seconds
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback must appear within 200ms of user action
- **Mobile Performance**: Form must be fully functional on 3G connections
