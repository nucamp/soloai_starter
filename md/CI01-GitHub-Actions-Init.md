# CI01-GitHub-Actions-Init.md

## Overview
Create a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow that automatically builds, tests, and validates the SaaS application on every push and pull request. This establishes automated quality gates and ensures consistent deployment readiness across all environments.

**Feature Type**: Technical Integration

**Business Value**: Reduces manual testing overhead, catches regressions early, and ensures consistent code quality across the development team.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Automated Build Validation**: Every push to main/develop branches triggers build process
- **Test Suite Execution**: Run complete Vitest unit tests and Playwright e2e tests automatically  
- **Multi-Environment Testing**: Test against Node.js 18+ LTS with matrix strategy
- **Dependency Caching**: Cache node_modules and build artifacts for faster execution
- **Test Result Reporting**: Display test results and coverage reports in GitHub UI
- **Build Artifact Storage**: Store build outputs for potential deployment use
- **Failure Notifications**: Clear feedback when builds or tests fail with actionable error messages

### Integration Requirements
- **Service Dependencies**: Start MySQL, Strapi, and Mautic containers for e2e tests
- **Environment Setup**: Load test environment variables securely
- **Database Seeding**: Initialize test database with required schema and seed data
- **API Mocking**: Mock external services (OpenAI, Stripe, LemonSqueezy) for reliable testing
- **Parallel Execution**: Run unit and e2e tests concurrently where possible

### Performance Requirements
- **Build Time**: Complete CI pipeline within 10 minutes under normal conditions
- **Test Execution**: Unit tests complete within 2 minutes, e2e tests within 8 minutes
- **Cache Efficiency**: Dependency caching reduces subsequent build times by 60%+
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize GitHub Actions minutes usage with efficient workflows

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow configuration
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ LTS with npm/yarn package manager
- **Docker**: For running service containers (MySQL, Strapi, Mautic)
- **Testing Frameworks**: Vitest from TS01-Vitest-Setup.md and Playwright from TS02-Playwright-Setup.md
- **Environment**: Test environment variables from EV01-Env-File-Setup.md patterns

### Workflow Structure
- **Trigger Events**: Push to main/develop branches, pull requests, manual workflow dispatch
- **Job Strategy**: Matrix build across Node.js versions, parallel job execution
- **Service Containers**: MySQL 8.0+ database container with proper networking
- **Secret Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for API keys following EV03-Secret-Management.md practices
- **Artifact Handling**: Store test reports, coverage data, and build outputs

### Required Environment Variables
- **Database**: `DATABASE_URL`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`
- **Authentication**: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- **Testing**: `NODE_ENV=test`, `CI=true`
- **Mock Services**: Test API keys for external service mocking
- **Coverage**: `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=80`

### Security Considerations
- **Secret Management**: Store sensitive credentials in GitHub Secrets, never in workflow files
- **Dependency Scanning**: Validate package integrity and check for known vulnerabilities
- **Permission Scoping**: Use minimal required permissions for workflow execution
- **Branch Protection**: Require CI success before merging to protected branches

## Additional Context for AI Assistant

### Prerequisites
This feature builds upon:
- **TS01-Vitest-Setup.md**: Unit testing configuration and test structure
- **TS02-Playwright-Setup.md**: E2E testing setup and browser automation
- **TS03-Write-Basic-Tests.md**: Existing test suite for auth, UI, and payment flows
- **DB01-DB-Container-Setup.md**: MySQL container configuration for CI database
- **EV01-Env-File-Setup.md**: Environment variable patterns and structure
- **EV03-Secret-Management.md**: Security practices for credential handling

### Integration Points
- **Test Execution**: Execute test suites created in previous testing setup guides
- **Service Dependencies**: Start required containers for full application testing
- **Environment Config**: Use established environment variable patterns from setup guides
- **Build Process**: Validate SvelteKit build process and static generation

### Workflow Requirements
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: Separate jobs for linting, building, unit tests, and e2e tests
- **Conditional Execution**: Skip expensive e2e tests for documentation-only changes
- **Status Checks**: Required status checks prevent merging failing code
- **Notification Integration**: Optional Slack/Discord notifications for team awareness

### Docker Integration
- **Service Networking**: Proper container networking for application-database communication
- **Health Checks**: Ensure services are ready before running tests
- **Resource Limits**: Optimize container resource allocation for CI environment
- **Clean Shutdown**: Proper container cleanup after test execution

The workflow should be production-ready, following GitHub Actions best practices while integrating seamlessly with the existing SaaS application architecture and testing infrastructure.
