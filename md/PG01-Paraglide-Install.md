# PG01-Paraglide-Install.md

## Overview
Install and configure Paraglide as the internationalization (i18n) solution for the SvelteKit application, enabling multilingual content delivery and establishing the foundation for AI-powered content localization. This integration will support dynamic language switching and prepare the application for automatic translation workflows with Strapi CMS content.

**Business Value**: Enable global market reach through multilingual support, improve user experience for international users, and establish infrastructure for automated content translation workflows.

**Feature Type**: Technical Integration

## Requirements

### Integration Specifications
- **Service Details**: Paraglide i18n library for SvelteKit with TypeScript support
- **Integration Points**: 
  - SvelteKit application routing system from A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md
  - Strapi CMS content from SP05-Strapi-Frontend-Connect.md
  - Future AI translation workflow preparation

### Functional Requirements
- Install Paraglide i18n library and configure for SvelteKit TypeScript project
- Set up project structure to support multiple languages with compile-time type safety
- Initialize default locale configuration with English as primary language
- Prepare message catalog structure for dynamic content from Strapi
- Configure build process to generate typed translation functions
- Establish foundation for language detection and locale persistence
- Support for both static UI text and dynamic CMS content translation
- Enable server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility for SEO optimization

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Paraglide installed with proper TypeScript definitions
- Project configured with initial locale structure
- Build process generates type-safe translation functions
- No breaking changes to existing routes from A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md
- Translation system ready for Strapi content integration
- Development server runs without errors after installation

### Data Requirements
- Language configuration files supporting multiple locales
- Message catalog structure for UI translations
- Locale detection and persistence mechanism
- Integration with existing environment variable structure from EV01-Env-File-Setup.md
- Support for pluralization and variable interpolation
- Namespace organization for different content types (UI, CMS, errors)

### Security Considerations
- Locale input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Secure storage of language preferences in browser
- Protection against malicious locale switching attempts
- Safe handling of user-provided translation content
- CSRF protection for language switching endpoints

### Performance Requirements
- Translation bundle optimization with tree-shaking
- Lazy loading of non-critical language packs
- Client-side caching of selected locale preferences
- Minimal impact on initial page load times (<100ms overhead)
- Efficient memory usage for multiple language catalogs

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- `@inlang/paraglide-js`: Core Paraglide library for JavaScript/TypeScript
- `@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit`: SvelteKit-specific adapter
- `@inlang/sdk`: Inlang SDK for project configuration
- Integration with existing SvelteKit setup and TypeScript configuration

### Project Structure Changes
- Create `messages/` directory for translation catalogs
- Add `project.inlang.json` configuration file in project root
- Modify `vite.config.js` to include Paraglide preprocessing
- Update `app.html` to support language attributes
- Configure TypeScript to recognize generated translation types

### Environment Variables
- `PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE`: Default application language (e.g., 'en')
- `PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LOCALES`: Comma-separated list of supported languages
- Integration with existing environment validation from EV02-Env-Validation.md

### Build Process Integration
- Configure Vite to preprocess Paraglide messages during build
- Generate TypeScript definitions for translation functions
- Set up development mode hot-reloading for translation changes
- Optimize production bundles with unused translation removal

## Integration Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Completed A01-Setup-Base-Routes.md (SvelteKit routing structure)
- Completed SP05-Strapi-Frontend-Connect.md (Strapi content integration)
- Completed EV01-Env-File-Setup.md (environment configuration)

### Breaking Changes
- None expected - Paraglide integrates with existing routing
- Language prefix routing will be added in PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md

### API Considerations
- Prepare for locale-aware API endpoints
- Support for Accept-Language header processing
- Integration with Strapi i18n plugin from SP02-Strapi-Content-Type.md

## Implementation Notes

### SvelteKit Integration
- Use Paraglide's SvelteKit adapter for seamless integration
- Configure paraglide preprocessing in `vite.config.js`
- Set up translation function imports in components
- Ensure compatibility with existing layout structure from A02-Create-Layout-Component.md

### Translation Function Generation
- Generate type-safe translation functions at build time
- Support for variable interpolation and pluralization
- Namespace organization for different content areas
- Error handling for missing translations with fallbacks

### Development Workflow
- Hot-reloading support for translation file changes
- Clear error messages for missing or malformed translations
- Development tools integration for translation management
- Preparation for future AI translation workflow from AI02-Content-Localization-Workflow.md

### Future Integration Points
- Language switcher component (PG02-Paraglide-Configure-Langs.md)
- Dynamic content translation (PG03-Paraglide-Translate-Content.md)
- AI-powered translation workflow (AI02-Content-Localization-Workflow.md)
- Mautic email localization (AI03-Email-Translation-Manager.md)

## Validation Requirements
- Verify installation with `npm run build` success
- Confirm TypeScript compilation without errors
- Test basic translation function generation
- Validate development server startup
- Ensure existing routes continue to function
- Verify compatibility with Tailwind CSS from A03-Configure-Tailwind-DaisyUI.md
