# Legal Content - Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

## Overview
Add comprehensive, legally compliant privacy policy and terms of service content to the `/privacy` and `/terms` routes. This establishes legal foundation for user data handling, service usage, and liability protection while supporting multilingual content delivery through existing Paraglide i18n system.

**Feature type:** User-Facing Feature

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a **potential user**, I want to read the privacy policy so that I understand how my personal data will be collected, used, and protected
- As a **registered user**, I want to access current terms of service so that I understand my rights and obligations when using the platform
- As a **compliance officer**, I want legally sound privacy and terms content so that the application meets GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements

### UI/UX Requirements
